										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In past articles, we have discussed some of the most important economic indicators that traders, investors, and other stakeholders are known to pay great attention to; the “<strong>Initial Jobless Claims</strong>” is undoubtedly one of them.</p>
<p>The report reveals the number of people who have recently become unemployed and are applying for unemployment benefits. By analyzing the records and figures the Initial Jobless Claims provides, market participants and policymakers can gain valuable insight into both the health of the labor market and the state of the overall economy.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll explain what the Initial Jobless Claims report is and why it is considered so important.</p>
<h2>What Are Initial Jobless Claims?</h2>
<p>As we just explained above, Initial Jobless Claims refer to the number of people who filed a claim for unemployment benefits with their state&#8217;s unemployment office for the first time after losing their job. These claims are a key component of the weekly Economic Indicators Report which, in the US, is published by the Department of Labor.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that the employment levels are usually sensible to economic expansions and retractions, it becomes easy to see how the Initial Jobless Claims report is seen and used as a barometer not only for the state of the labor market but also for the overall national economic condition.</p>
<p>Analysts and policymakers rely on this data to make informed decisions regarding economic policies, social safety nets, and business strategies. By closely monitoring initial jobless claims, all interested parties can gain insights into the impacts of economic events, such as recessions and unexpected crises such as the recent global pandemics, and can devise appropriate measures to mitigate their effects.</p>
<h3>Why the Initial Jobless Claims are so important for traders and investors?</h3>
<p>The importance of the IJC to traders and investors derives from the fact that it can be viewed not only as an indicator of the current economic situation but also as an insight into what is likely to happen next.</p>
<p>Let’s take a minute to analyze this better.</p>
<p>The most direct and immediate use of the Initial Jobless Claims report is as an <strong>indicator of economic health</strong>.</p>
<p>High numbers of initial jobless claims are often associated with a weakening labor market and can indicate an economic downturn, a slowing down, or, in extreme cases, a recession. Whilst, on the other hand, a decline in claims can signal improving employment prospects and overall economic growth.</p>
<p>Initial jobless claims can act and it can be seen as an <strong>early warning system for related economic issues.</strong></p>
<p>Clearly, an increase in jobless claims is seldom a good sign; it may foreshadow an imminent contraction in consumer spending followed by poorer market conditions and reduced economic growth.</p>
<p>The Initial Jobless Claims report is also considered of great importance for the impact that it can have on consumer confidence which, in turn, can have a major effect on the economy. After all, it is only natural that <a href="https://.com/unemployment-rate/">unemployment</a> creates uncertainty and that can turn into financial stress for individuals and their families. This again can (and often does)  lead to a decrease in consumer spending, which, of course, is a significant driving force for economic growth. It is because of this that, Initial Jobless Claims have a direct influence on consumer confidence, overall economic stability, and, ironically, on future unemployment level and jobless claims too.</p>
<h3>What effect does the New Jobless Claims report have on the stock market?</h3>
<p>When interpreting initial jobless claims, it is important to put the figures into context within the bigger picture. You must look beyond a single week&#8217;s data, as these can be influenced by various factors (i.e. seasonal fluctuations, reforms, weather conditions,  etc.) or administrative problems. You should focus instead on indicators such as the four-week moving average (the average of initial claims over the previous four weeks) to get a better understanding of the overall status and dynamics of the labor market.</p>
<p>The relationship between the initial jobless claims and the stock market is often complicated because it is based on different factors with different timelines. The effect that one has on the other is not always easy to predict but there are, nonetheless, factors that it is useful to consider; here are a few.</p>
<p><strong>The first thing that feels the impact of the Initial Jobless Claims report is market sentiment.</strong> Higher-than-expected jobless claims may lead to a decline in investor confidence, potentially causing stock prices to fall and, naturally, the opposite is true too.</p>
<p>As we just discussed, Initial Jobless Claims can provide insight into the health of the labor market and the overall economy. If jobless claims increase significantly, for example, it may be seen as <strong>revealing economic weakness or as a reason to prepare for “under-expectation” corporate earnings</strong> in the near future. Both these scenarios often lead to falling stock prices.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6236" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-Jobless-Claims.jpg" alt="U.S. initial jobless claims" width="740" height="337" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-Jobless-Claims.jpg 740w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-Jobless-Claims-300x137.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></p>
<p>In past articles, we explained that the main functions of the Federal Banks are to safeguard the value of the US Dollar and the level of employment in the Country. It is only natural then that: <strong>high jobless claims may persuade the FED to adopt expansionary monetary policies</strong>, such as <strong>lowering interest rates</strong> or implementing <strong>asset purchase programs</strong>.</p>
<p>Usually, when the FED decides to act this way, traders can expect a positive response from the market, as a lower interest rate may make stocks more attractive than other assets.</p>
<p>It is important to also consider <strong>the impact New Jobless Sales can have on specific industries</strong>.<br />
As discussed, changes in jobless claims numbers can directly influence market and consumer confidence; sectors heavily reliant on consumer spending, such as retail and travel, hospitality, and entertainment are more easily influenced and their stock prices may show greater volatility in response to jobless claims data.</p>
<p>For day traders in particular, it’s important to consider that the stock market&#8217;s reaction to jobless claims is very reliant on expectations and, in particular, to the way the newly released numbers compare to forecasts. If the actual jobless claims figure is better or worse than expected, it may affect market sentiment and stock prices in either a positive or negative way.</p>
<h2>Note that…</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the stock market is influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, company-specific news, and investor sentiment. Therefore, while initial jobless claims can be a factor, they are just one among many that constantly influence the stock market&#8217;s movement.</p>
<p>`Adding this knowledge to your technical analysis can give you a competitive edge and help you to improve your trading strategy.</p>
<p>Thanks for following us and, as always, I hope this helps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>At Funded Trades  Now For You, we always strive to produce articles that can help traders become more and more successful by introducing concepts and techniques that might be new or unclear to some people. We spoke about both fundamental issues such as <a href="https://.com/gdp-growth-rate/">GDP</a>, <a href="https://.com/unemployment-rate/">Unemployment</a>, <a href="https://.com/the-fed-beige-book/">the FED</a>, <a href="https://.com/home-sales-report/">the New Home Sales report</a>, and much more (all of which you can find on our <a href="https://.com/blog/">blog page</a>) and different aspects of technical analysis such as candlestick and chart patterns clearly explained in our <a href="https://lp..com/ebook/">ebook</a> (and you can also find that on our website).<br />
We intend to carry on in these steps and provide even more value to our traders as we go on because helping traders, both economically and educationally, is excartly what we do!</p>
<p>That being said and with no further ado, let’s talk about today’s topic: <strong>Reading the Tape</strong>.</p>
<h2>What does “reading the tape” mean in trading?</h2>
<p>When traders talk about “reading the tape”, they are referring to a technique that involves analyzing and interpreting the information displayed on what is still called a “ticker tape”, which &#8211; even in today’s electronic format &#8211; represents movements in stock prices and trading volumes in real-time. It does that by displaying a continuous stream of data, including price updates, bid and ask prices, trade volume, and other very relevant information.</p>
<p>When traders &#8220;read the tape&#8221;, they observe and analyze data to gain a better insight and understanding of current market trends, price movements, and investor sentiment. It’s a matter of looking for patterns, significant price movements, or changes in trading volume that could indicate potential opportunities to meet Mr. Profit.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6071" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/reading-the-tape-st.jpg" alt="reading the tape" width="449" height="515" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/reading-the-tape-st.jpg 449w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/reading-the-tape-st-262x300.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /></p>
<h2>The three main factors you should look out for when reading the tape.</h2>
<h3>Price Movements:</h3>
<p>Monitor how prices are changing in real-time. Look out for significant increases or decreases, breakouts from key levels, or even reversals.<br />
These price movements can provide you with important indications of market sentiment and potential trading opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Trading Volume:</h3>
<p>Observe the volume of trades taking place. You can get a pretty good idea of the interest level and participation in a particular stock or market.<br />
Unusually high volume could indicate strong buying or selling pressure, potentially signaling a trend continuation in some cases or a reversal in others.</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Order Flow:</h3>
<p>Pay attention to the bid and ask sizes and prices. You will be better positioned to understand the current market’s supply and demand dynamics.<br />
Large or aggressive orders can indicate institutional buying or selling, which might influence price movements and offer you another chance to meet the same Mr. Profit from earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://ftnfu.com/login"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5949" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="126" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner.jpg 728w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner-300x52.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></a></p>
<h2>Five “Tape Reading Tactics” to get you started.</h2>
<p>Here are five of the most popular Tape Reading Tactics you can start familiarizing yourself with right now.</p>
<h3>“Order Book Analysis” tactic.</h3>
<p>Analyze the depth and size of the order book. This can help you identify areas of support and resistance that you can then draw on your chart. Look out for large buy or sell orders (“icebergs”); they often indicate significant buying or selling pressure which could confirm or reverse the current trend.</p>
<h3>“Time and Sales Analysis” tactic.</h3>
<p>Monitor the time and sales data, which displays real-time trade executions. Analyzing the speed and volume of the trades that you see, can provide you with a very interesting insight into market sentiment and potential short-term price movements.</p>
<h3>“Volume Profile Analysis” tactic.</h3>
<p>Make a point of examining the volume profile, which shows the trading volume at different price levels over a specified period. This analysis can help you to identify areas on the chart with a high level of trading activity which &#8211; again &#8211; you can use to determine potential level of support and resistance.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6069" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/super-dom.jpg" alt="qqq super dom" width="600" height="366" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/super-dom.jpg 600w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/super-dom-300x183.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<h3>“Level 2 Data Analysis” tactic.</h3>
<p>Simply put, the Level 2 Data Analysis tactic consists of analyzing information regarding the bid and ask prices and the order sizes outside of the best bid and ask. You can monitor the level 2 data to identify potential areas of interest, such as heavy buying or selling pressure at specific price levels.</p>
<h3>“Tape Reading Pattern” tactic.</h3>
<p>Experienced tape readers often develop their own set of patterns based on historical price and order flow data. These patterns may indicate potential reversals, breakouts, or the presence of institutional buying/selling. With time you’ll be able to do that in an expert manner too but, for now, nothing stops you from giving it a go and trying things out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Could Tape Reading be a good strategy for you?</h2>
<h3>What do the studies say?</h3>
<p>Numerous studies have been conducted on Tape Reading. These studies were mainly aimed at establishing whether Tape Reading offers any actual trading advantages compared to other techniques and strategies and, if so, to whom</p>
<p>It turns out, Tape Reading absolutely does offer numerous benefits. It can put traders in a much better position to “have a real-time feel” for exactly what is going on in the market right whilst it is going on!<br />
Studies on Tape Reading also suggest that it is not a “do-it-all” strategy and that it’s not suitable for everyone. Tape Reading, as powerful as it might be, does come with its limitations (and what doesn’t?).<br />
Interpreting the order flow’, for example, can be a very subjective business as different traders might interpret the same data differently. It can also be very hard, whilst Tape Reading, to distinguish and separate useful signals from the general chaos of random fluctuations.</p>
<p>Another thing that the Reading the Tape studies suggest is that this strategy is way more effective when it’s adopted and used in conjunction with at least another signalling method. Either a technical or a fundamental indicator would be appropriate. It is when different strategies or indicators confirm one another that Reading the Tape provides the best benefits.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Determining if tape reading is the best form of trading for you involves understanding the nature of tape reading and assessing how it aligns with your trading goals, personality, skill set, and risk tolerance.</p>
<p>Remember, trading is highly individualistic, and what works for one person may not work for another. Exploring different trading strategies and adjusting based on your strengths, preferences, and goals is essential for finding the most suitable approach for you.</p>
<p>Once again, hope this helps.<br />
Trade on, traders!</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <strong>Home Sale Report</strong> is one of those indicators that, if understood correctly, can offer you as a trader a major advantage for it gives a valuable insight into the current state of the entire economic and financial situation as well as helping to predict imminent changes. In particular, The US New Home Sales Report is also closely monitored and seen as a vital economic indicator by traders, market participants, analysts, and many other stakeholders, nationally and all over the globe.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll try to explain why the Home Sales Report is so important and how it affects different types of stakeholders.</p>
<h2>What is the Home Sale Report?</h2>
<p>In the US, the New Home Sales Report is published by the <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/housing.html">Census Bureau and the Department of Housing</a> and Urban Development (HUD) every month.<br />
It has been created to track the number of newly constructed homes sold during a specific period. The data is based on surveys conducted among homebuilders across the Nation, each providing information regarding sales, prices, and inventory levels.</p>
<h2>Why is it so important?</h2>
<p>The huge importance of the New Home Sales Report derives from many factors but the following few are undoubtedly the most important ones:</p>
<h3>It is considered an indicator of the overall economic health of the nation.</h3>
<p>The New Home Sales report helps measure the overall health of the housing sector, which is critical to the overall economy. Because the acquisition of a new home involves many sectors such as building, real estate, and finance, it acts as an indicator of economic activity.<br />
It reflects market sentiment.<br />
The report provides an extremely valuable insight into consumer demand for newly constructed housing. It reflects potential homebuyers&#8217; sentiment, their confidence in the economy, and their ability to secure an appropriate mortgage agreement and finance.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5956" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/new-residential-sales.jpg" alt="Home sales report - new residential sales" width="640" height="459" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/new-residential-sales.jpg 640w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/new-residential-sales-300x215.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>It highlights current Housing Market Trends.</h3>
<p>The New Home Sales Report helps identify housing market trends by tracking changes in the number of new house sales. It displays patterns of demand, supply, and pricing, which can help in understanding market dynamics and projecting future changes.</p>
<h3>It influences Policy and Planning.</h3>
<p>Government entities, including the Federal Reserve and policymakers, rely on the US New Home Sales report to assess the effectiveness of policies aimed at promoting economic growth. It helps them formulate strategies related to interest rates, housing regulations, and infrastructure development.</p>
<h2>What stakeholders does the New Home Sales Report affect the most and how?</h2>
<p>Other than being a great indicator of the overall economic health of the nation, the New Home Sales Report has a direct &#8211; and very practical &#8211; impact on a variety of stakeholders across different sectors and industries.<br />
Let’s take a quick look at the most obvious and immediate ones:</p>
<h3>Construction / Homes builders.</h3>
<p>The report is most significant for homebuilders as it helps them assess market conditions and make informed decisions regarding inventory levels, new projects, and pricing strategies. The New Home Report data can aid them in monitoring demand patterns and adjusting their expectations and new construction schedules. The report makes them better equipped to create future forecasts, choose valuable areas, and monitor buyers&#8217; sentiment.</p>
<h3>Property Retail / Real Estate Agents.</h3>
<p>Real estate professionals also closely monitor the New Home Sales report to identify new trends and trend changes and, as a consequence, adjust their marketing strategies accordingly. To Real Estate Agents, the New Home Sales Report provides more insights into buyer preferences and market opportunities than any survey they could run on their own.</p>
<p><a href="https://.com/#packages"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5949" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="126" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner.jpg 728w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner-300x52.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></a></p>
<h3>Investors / Traders.</h3>
<p>Investors as well as traders, particularly those involved and focused in the construction and real estate sectors, pay “super-close” attention to the report. It helps them assess the profitability and growth prospects of companies in these industries, thus influencing investment decisions.<br />
They might use the report to predict changes in revenue for companies involved in raw material extraction, building material manufacturing, logistics, plants and machinery, construction, marketing, and, obviously, sales.</p>
<h3>Homebuyers / Homesellers.</h3>
<p>Although most don’t actually actively monitor it (unless really keen and dedicated), the New Home Sales Report; &#8216;s findings have a huge impact on both homebuyers and homesellers. Real estate market dynamics, as reflected in the report, can influence pricing strategies, lending conditions, housing affordability, and credit availability. Needless to say, these are all integral aspects of the Housing Market and any change in one of these can literally transform the market’s conditions.</p>
<h2>3 tips to trade the New Home Sales Report</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Monitor market expectations and sentiment.</h3>
<p>Before the report is released, pay attention to market expectations and sentiment. Analysts and economists often provide their predictions and forecasts too. Compare these expectations to historical trends and market sentiment so that you can estimate the potential impact and changes on the market.<br />
Also, look out for any deviations from expectations that could create trading opportunities.</li>
<li>
<h3>Analyze the data and trends.</h3>
<p>Once the New Home Sales report is released, take a careful look at the data that’s been provided. Look for trends and patterns in new home sales, sales prices, and inventory levels. Compare the current report to past reports to spot any noteworthy changes that may have an influence on the housing market and related assets.</li>
<li>
<h3>Examine the larger economic context.</h3>
<p>When trading the New Home Sales report, it is extremely important to examine the broader economic situation. There are other major economic indicators to monitor such as employment level, interest rates, and consumer sentiment. These factors (and many others) can have an impact on the property market and provide useful information for your trading and stock selection.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not forget to pay special attention to the New Home Sales Report if you want to trade in the construction and Real Estate sectors. But, also, don’t forget to monitor it every month because, as we just said, it offers a sneaky insight into the overall economy of the Nation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The FED keeps itself informed! Do you?</h2>
<p>The FED Beige Book serves as a valuable resource for understanding the economic conditions and trends across the United States. Published eight times a year by the Federal Reserve, it contains essential information collected from business contacts, economists, and other sources. With this article, we’ll try to explain the significance of the Beige Book, its purpose, and the important role it plays in providing vital information to policymakers, businesses, and financial market participants.</p>
<h2>What is the FED Beige Book and what is its purpose?</h2>
<p>Created in the seventies as the “Red Book, it was first published to provide the Federal Reserve with valuable economic information at a regional level which helps it gain a better and fuller picture of the current economic condition as a whole.<br />
With the passing of the years, both the color of the cover and the name of the “book” have changed but its main function remained &#8211; and remains today &#8211; the same. The Beige Book is composed of a collection of anecdotal information that will then go to complement all the other data gathered by the various Federal Reserve research departments.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the Beige Book is to:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Gather information on the current state of the economy</li>
<li aria-level="1">Assess changes in economic activity</li>
<li aria-level="1">Identify emerging trends</li>
<li aria-level="1">Inform monetary policy decisions</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to collect this information and elaborate on it, the FED contacts a wide range of businesses, including local retailers, manufacturers, builders, farmers, and bankers, to obtain qualitative data on their observations and individual experiences.</p>
<h2>Why is the Beige Book important?</h2>
<h3>It helps the FED make informed decisions</h3>
<p>The Beige Book provides a comprehensive analysis of the economic conditions on a regional and national scale. Naturally, it covers various sectors, such as manufacturing, housing, consumer spending, agriculture, and labor markets.<br />
Collecting qualitative data, helps the Beige Book fill the gaps left by traditional economic indicators and helps provide a more complete picture.<br />
The qualitative information contained in the Beige Book is, in a way, the representation of the economic condition in everyday life.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve uses the Beige Book as part of its decision-making process regarding monetary policy. Combining this qualitative information with quantitative indicators, it helps policymakers understand how economic conditions are evolving between each of the official data releases.<br />
It is based on this understanding that the FED can make well-informed decisions on everything from interest rates to monetary stimulus, and tightening measures to ensure stability, growth, and control inflation.</p>
<p>To learn more about <a href="https://.com/?s=fed&amp;submit=submit">the FED</a> and the role it plays in the US economy, read abou it on our <a href="https://.com/?s=fed&amp;submit=submit">blog</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4662" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/federal-reserve-districts.jpg" alt="federal reserve districts - beige book" width="649" height="490" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/federal-reserve-districts.jpg 649w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/federal-reserve-districts-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" /></p>
<h3>It highlights economic variation all the way down to a regional level</h3>
<p>The United States is a large and diverse country and regional economic variations are therefore inevitable.<br />
Thanks to the Beige Book, policymakers can monitor how different regions perform, identify potential disparities, and take all this knowledge on board when making decisions.<br />
In addition, the information from the Beige Book helps the Fed and the markets understand both the relationship that exists between regional economies and the impact each region has on the national economy.</p>
<h3>Timing is key</h3>
<p>The timing with which the Beige Book is normally published is also another crucial aspect of its importance.<br />
It is released two weeks before each <a href="https://.com/fomc/">FOMC</a> (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting, ensuring that the latest information is available to policymakers.</p>
<p>Also, the timely release makes it accessible to private-sector economists, media outlets, market participants, and the general public, which is thought of as promoting transparency and, possibly, informed discussions.</p>
<p><a href="https://.com/#packages"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3474" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2.jpg" alt="ttp - a prop firm for Forex Traders" width="960" height="120" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2.jpg 960w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2-300x38.jpg 300w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2-768x96.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></p>
<h3>It’s a great insight for Businesses, Investors, and traders</h3>
<p>Apart from guiding monetary policy, the Beige Book also offers valuable insights for businesses, investors, and traders.<br />
By understanding the economic conditions and trends depicted in the book, businesses can make more informed decisions whilst Investors can assess risks and opportunities at a regional level and align their strategies accordingly.<br />
Traders, on the other hand, could find extremely insightful clues for early indications of change of condition and profit from stock price volatility that would be likely to follow. For traders, the Beige Book serves as an early warning system, highlighting potential changes in economic conditions before they are fully evident in officially released data.<br />
The fact that the economic condition is scaled down to the regional level is often of even greater benefit to those traders who tend to specialize in specific sectors but, overall, the Beige Book is an essential tool for all stock market traders and investors as it provides valuable information and insights on the current economic environment, future trends, market sentiment, and potential impacts on monetary policy.</p>
<p>Learning to properly interpret and understand the Beige Book would certainly help traders make more informed investment decisions and navigate the complexities of the stock market more effectively.</p>
<h2>So… in conclusion…</h2>
<p>The Beige Book is an important and essential tool that provides an in-depth, qualitative analysis of the US economic conditions and trends.<br />
It plays a vital role in informing policymakers, businesses, and market participants about the state of the economy, and assisting in making well-informed decisions.</p>
<h2>Remember</h2>
<p>Once you are able to interpret it and understand it properly, remember that each <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/publications/beige-book-default.htm">publication of the Beige Book</a> has the potential to move prices in the market, reverse trends, and, most importantly, offer profits to be made.</p>
<p>As usual, I hope this helped.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the United States, interest rates are predominantly determined by the Federal Reserve.<br />
The FED uses monetary policy tools to maximize employment and stabilize the Dollar mainly by controlling the interest rate (to learn more about the Fed, take a look at <a href="https://.com/fomc/">FOMC</a>).</p>
<p>On Wednesday 26th of July this year, in its effort to bring inflation down to the  2% target, the Fed raised the rate by another quarter of a percentage point to reach<strong> 5.5%, the highest interest rate in the US in 22 years.</strong><br />
It was the 11th rate hike since March 2022 and it follows a brief pause during the previous month to monitor the situation and evaluate the effects of the increases so far on inflation and on the economy.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4605" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rate-hikes-2022-2023.jpg" alt="interest rate hike 202202023" width="740" height="432" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rate-hikes-2022-2023.jpg 740w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rate-hikes-2022-2023-300x175.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></p>
<p>Despite the seemingly falling inflation level, Jerome Powell, the FOMC president, justified this decision by explaining that, because employment remained very high and the economy very strong, there is still room for inflation to rise and spiral out of control. In other words, “stopping now could still be too risky”.</p>
<p><strong>But what if the Fed were to misjudge the economy&#8217;s resilience and set the interest rate too high?</strong> What would happen then?<br />
Let’s try and figure that out.</p>
<h2>What risks would the economy face if the Fed was to raise interest rates too high?</h2>
<p>As it is easy to imagine, if the FED were to raise interest rates excessively high, intentionally or unintentionally, it could have several profound effects on the US economy.<br />
The first to come to mind, for example, are the following:</p>
<h3>Impact on Borrowing and Investment</h3>
<p>The very first thing that excessively high interest rates would directly impact is, of course, borrowing costs.<br />
Having to pay high interest on their debts would immediately discourage individuals and businesses from taking out further loans or borrowing capital to finance new projects.<br />
Higher borrowing costs would also reduce consumer spending and business investments, two of the most vital drivers of the Nation’s economic growth.<br />
<strong>All in all, reduced investments would mean reduced expenditure and limited growth in productivity which, in turn, would lead to job losses.</strong></p>
<h3>Contraction in Overall Economic Activity</h3>
<p>An increase in interest rates might lead to a contraction in overall economic activity (recession).<br />
As we said, higher borrowing costs would reduce consumer spending (which accounts for a significant portion of the US economy) and a decline in consumer spending would affect various sectors with retail, hospitality, and leisure industries amongst the first in line.<br />
Ultimately, businesses across these sectors (and not only) would experience much lower demand causing layoffs and, ultimately, business closures.</p>
<h3>Effects on the Real Estate Market</h3>
<p>The real estate sector is amongst the most sensitive to interest rate changes.<br />
<strong>Higher interest rates would immediately increase mortgage rates and decrease affordability, negatively affecting potential homebuyers as well as homeowners with an existing mortgage. This would lead to a decline in demand for housing, and cause a slowdown in the construction industry.</strong><br />
Existing homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages would be negatively affected too for they would face higher monthly payments, potentially leading to an increase in delinquencies and foreclosures.</p>
<h3>Stock Market Volatility</h3>
<p><strong>As a trader, you’ll be particularly interested to know that Interest rates significantly impact stock market behavior.</strong><br />
<strong>When rates rise too high, investors tend to shift their investments from stocks to fixed-income securities.</strong> Dividend-paying stocks become relatively less attractive when bond yields increase whilst offering virtually no risks.<br />
As investors reallocate their assets and switch from stock to bonds, the stock market may experience substantial volatility and a potential decline in equity prices (although this would not necessarily be a bad thing for short-sell traders looking for volatility and opportunities).</p>
<h3>Exchange Rates and International Trade</h3>
<p><strong>Higher interest rates usually tend to attract foreign capital as investors seek higher returns for their investments.</strong> This capital inflow strengthens the Dollar and that can have unintended consequences for international trade. After all, a stronger dollar makes US exports more expensive for other Countries and often makes imported goods cheaper than the ones domestically produced. It’s easy to see how this can quickly lead to an extreme trade deficit with enormous damage to the domestic industries (especially those exporting their products and services abroad). Once again, this also would have detrimental effects on unemployment levels.</p>
<h3>Impact on Government Debt</h3>
<p>Interest rates too high would also significantly impact the US government&#8217;s ability to finance its debt. <strong>Higher borrowing costs would increase the interest payments on outstanding government debt and make further debt more expensive, potentially straining the federal budget.</strong> This situation would result in reduced government spending in other areas or additional borrowing, eventually leading to higher deficits and an even bigger “debt problem”.</p>
<p><a href="https://.com/#packages"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3474" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2.jpg" alt="ttp - a prop firm for Forex Traders" width="960" height="120" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2.jpg 960w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2-300x38.jpg 300w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2-768x96.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></p>
<h2>So… with all that said, what is the threshold? What is the highest interest rate the American economy could cope with before a recession would be unavoidable?</h2>
<p>To pinpoint an exact interest rate threshold that would guarantee a recession would be, at the very least, challenging.</p>
<p>Factors such as the health of the economy, existing debt levels, and government intervention make it difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, historical data can provide clues and help us to understand the relationship between interest rates and the potential resulting economic performance.</p>
<p>Data tells us that throughout history, interest rates rising above 6-8% have often been associated with economic slowdowns or recessions (let’s keep in mind the rate is currently at 5.5% and that it has been sitting at 0% for over a year and only up to just 16 months ago). However, it is also important to remember that each economic cycle is unique, and the US economy has demonstrated its resilience to periods of higher interest rates just like during this current one.</p>
<p><strong>Determining the highest interest rate the US economy could cope with before recession becomes inevitable is a very complex task.</strong> The US economy&#8217;s ability to withstand higher interest rates depends on various interrelated factors. As interest rates rise, they have the potential to adversely affect consumer spending, business investments, and the housing market.<br />
While historical patterns suggest an interest rate threshold for recession, it is essential to consider the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the economy.</p>
<h2>And what about Businesses? Is it possible to predict the highest interest rates each company could cope with before “getting in trouble” and seeing the price of its stock crashing?</h2>
<p>Well, I’m guessing that’s the next question that a trader would want to ask.</p>
<p>The short answer is… “That would also be a very complicated task but there are ways”. A common one is to monitor the Debt to Equity Ratio (D/E Ratio) of the underlying companies of the stock you intend to trade.</p>
<p>We will talk about Debt to Equity Ratio in more detail in another article since its relevance increases step by step with the increase of the interest rate.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Federal Reserve&#8217;s recent decision to raise interest rates to 5.5%, the highest in over two decades, reflects their aim to control inflation and ensure economic stability. While inflation is easing, the move seeks to maintain employment and prevent potential economic downturns. However, excessive rate hikes could discourage borrowing and investment, impacting sectors like retail and real estate. Stock markets might become more volatile, and a stronger Dollar could harm international trade. Government debt management could also be challenged. While historical trends suggest a recession threshold around 6-8%, pinpointing an exact limit is complex due to the dynamic economy. Businesses&#8217; vulnerability varies, with the Debt to Equity Ratio a key indicator. Striking the right balance in rate adjustments remains vital to avoid unintended consequences and sustain economic health.</p>
<p>Hope this helped;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Amongst others, the two most commonly used methods to calculate <a href="https://.com/inflation/">inflation</a> are the<strong> CPI and the PCE</strong>. Although different from each other, both methods consist in periodically comparing prices within a certain sample group of products and services.<br />
Whilst a yearly price increase (inflation) of 2% is considered ideal, a decrease in prices (deflation) is seldom seen as a positive sign for the economy.<br />
In this article, we aim to examine CPI and PCEPI a little further and to find out why, while the Government looks at one, the FED chooses to look at the other.</p>
<h2>Measuring inflation: weight and scope</h2>
<p>Both the CPI (Consumer Price Index) and the PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure) attempt to estimate inflation levels by comparing prices in a basket of goods and services purchased by the urban population (which in the US is equal to just over 80% of citizens), over a period of time.</p>
<p>As a trader and a market participant, you may have realized that, despite the common objective, the BLS (Bureau of Labour Statistics)’s CPI and the BEA (Bureau of Economic Analysis)&#8217;s PCE produce inflation level estimates that can differ and, sometimes, can do so significantly.<br />
This is due to the fact that CPI and PCE are calculated in different ways, especially concerning <em>weight</em> and <em>scope</em>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3558 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pce-compared-to-cpi-min.jpg" alt="how does the pce weigh items compared to the cpi" width="740" height="344" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pce-compared-to-cpi-min.jpg 740w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pce-compared-to-cpi-min-300x139.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></p>
<p>As the BLS itself explains on its own website:<br />
<em>“The weight effect is a result of differences in how consumer expenditure data are sourced. CPI sources data from consumers, while PCE sources from businesses. The scope effect is a result of the different types of expenditures CPI and PCE track. For example, CPI only tracks out-of-pocket consumer medical expenditures, but PCE also tracks expenditures made for consumers, thus including employer contributions. The implications of these differences are considerable. Many contracts and government programs are tied to inflation, from rental agreements to social security”.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://.com/#packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3474 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2.jpg" alt="ttp - a prop firm for Forex Traders" width="960" height="120" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2.jpg 960w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2-300x38.jpg 300w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2-768x96.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></p>
<p>It’s a little confusing at first so here is what it all means:</p>
<p>When monitoring the prices of goods and services within the basket, the Bureau of Labour Statistics sources its information <strong>from the consumers</strong>. The BLS &#8211; as they put it &#8211; monitors, and records the price of around 80,000 items every month “representing a scientifically selected sample of the price paid by consumers of goods and services purchased.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3587 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pce-cpi.jpg" alt="pce cpi" width="706" height="630" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pce-cpi.jpg 706w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pce-cpi-300x268.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, the Bureau of Economic Analysis sources its information directly from businesses. Furthermore, when calculating the PCE, the BEA also takes into consideration aspects that play no part in CPI calculations such as income, taxation, and disposable income.<br />
This makes PCE more able to reflect changes in sales, alternative product purchases, and price increases also in relation to disposable income.<br />
CPI and PCEPI also differ in terms of weight &#8211; the “importance” of the price of a single product compared to the rest. For example, an increase in the price of milk has more impact on the whole inflation estimate than an increase in shoe prices because the standard consumer would buy milk more often than he buys shoes.</p>
<p>It must also be noted that historically, the goods and services in the CPI baskets were only adjusted every two years which made it less accurate and reliable. However, as of January 2022, the CPI basket is updated yearly.</p>
<h2>So, PCI or PCE? Which of these does the FED look at as the true <em>American inflation estimates</em>?</h2>
<p>Until the year 2000 both the Fed and the Government referred to the Consumer Price Index as the best estimate of national inflation (or deflation).<br />
The Government still does so these days. It takes into consideration CPI figures when making or changing economic policies such as adjustments to social security.<br />
At the start of the new millennium, however, the FOMC voted in favor of the adoption of the PCE as their new source of inflation estimate. The Fed focuses on PCE when making its quarterly projections, when taking measures to limit inflation, and when setting inflation targets.<br />
Despite the initial controversy, the reason for the FOMC decision in 2000, was explained by the FED itself as follows:<br />
“After extensive analysis, [the FED] changed to PCE inflation for three main reasons: The expenditure weights in the PCE can change as people substitute away from some goods and services toward others, the PCE includes more comprehensive coverage of goods and services, and historical PCE data can be revised”.</p>
<p>Well then, there we have it. CPI and PCE announcements are both extremely important for the Government, for the FED, for the economy and, of course, for the market and for you as a trader. Make sure to mark those dates on your calendar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2> Introduction</h2>
<p>The peace at which the national GDP increases is, naturally, of great interest to the FED and to all traders and investors.<br />
The capability to offer insights into the exchange of products and services across markets makes the GDP Growth Rate an excellent indicator of the condition of the Country&#8217;s economy.<br />
In this article, we’ll find out what the GDP is and why its growth is so important.</p>
<h2>What is GDP and what does it include?</h2>
<p><strong>The simplest way to explain the GDP is to describe it as the way we measure the monetary value of all products and services produced within a country and sold to the final consumer in a given time period.  </strong></p>
<p>GDP is universally recognized as the most representative <a href="https://.com/best-technical-indicators-for-day-trading-stocks/">indicator</a> of the size of a Country’s economy while the GDP Growth Rate is best suited to offer an insight into its economy’s health.<br />
In the US, GDP figures are calculated and released quarterly by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. <strong>Generally, a GDP Growth Rate of 2%-3% is considered ideal</strong> but any rate above zero would show an economy is growing whilst a negative rate would indicate a contracting economy.</p>
<p>The FED pays a great deal of attention to the GDP Growth Rate figures as it is inversely correlated to the unemployment rate; a growing economy is more likely to require a greater workforce.</p>
<p>As a trader, you too should pay the same level of attention to every GDP figure released keeping in mind that any surprise result can easily and drastically move virtually all markets.</p>
<h3>What exactly is included in GDP calculations?</h3>
<p>There are four distinct elements within an economy that need to be considered when calculating national GDP and GDP Growth Rate. These are Consumption, Government Spending, Investments, and Net Exports.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3472 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GDP-calculations.jpg" alt="GDP-calculations" width="500" height="308" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GDP-calculations.jpg 500w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GDP-calculations-300x185.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>GDP = C + G + I + NX</p>
<h4>C: Consumption.<br />
“Consumption” is consumer spending and it includes all general day-to-day personal and business expenses.</h4>
<p>Let’s take for example a person going to the ice cream parlor to treat himself after a hard day at work.<br />
The price he pays for the ice cream will be included in the GDP figure as well as the parlor’s staff’s wage, energy bills, and rent. Of course, also part of GDP calculations is the value of the ice cream&#8217;s ingredients, the cost of the fuel necessary to drive to the shop, the wage this person has earned, and the services he or she has provided during the hard day at work and… well, you get the idea.</p>
<h4>G: Government Spending</h4>
<p>The Government spending figure includes all its expenses at the federal, State, and local agencies levels. Health care and defense spending are part of the national GDP as well as the cost of constantly improving and maintaining infrastructure and those related to the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of the Government.</p>
<p>It is important to note that national Debt, national debt repayment, and transfer payments such as Social Security are <strong>NOT</strong> included in the GDP calculation.</p>
<h4>I: Investments</h4>
<p>When it comes to GDP calculation, the term “investment” refers to the value of all business investments in new capital goods such as land, buildings, and equipment. It does also include large personal investments such as home buying but <strong>NOT</strong> investments made in stock, bonds, or any other financial market.</p>
<h4>NX: Net Exports</h4>
<p>Simply put, Net Export is the difference between the Nation’s imports and exports value.</p>
<p>A Country that exports more than it imports (in value terms) would have a positive Net Export (called a “<em>trade surplus</em>”). In the opposite scenario, a Country would have a negative Net Export (called a “<em>trade deficit</em>”).</p>

<h2>The two economies</h2>
<p>The fact that investments in the financial market are not included in GDP calculation can often give the impression of the existence of two economies within a Country.<br />
The GDP figures reflect what is generally referred to as “the real economy” whilst financial investments can be seen as one of its byproducts; one with such a great amount of capital involvement to be able to create a “second economy.</p>
<p><strong>The “two economies” are strictly correlated and, usually, when one flourishes, the other often follows</strong>. However, it is important to remember that while GDP calculations only take into consideration the current state of the economy, markets trading and investment are made based on future expectations. This means that the real economy and the markets don’t always move in parallel lines; the two can differ enormously in performance, results, and degrees of success. During the Covid pandemic, for example, the US saw a drastic reduction in GDP (caused primarily by work and movement limitations) whist the Stock market reaches its all-time high with companies such as Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet breaking the $1 trillion market-cap level (and then some).</p>
<p>Always keep an eye out for every GDP release and, of course,  for our next article too.<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that we all know that the Fed can (and does) lower the <a href="https://.com/fomc/">interest rate</a> to boost economic <a href="https://.com/unemployment-rate/">growth and employment</a> or it can raise it to fight <a href="https://.com/inflation/">inflation</a>, let’s talk a little about the other, relatively new &#8211; power that the FED has at its disposal: <strong>money printing. A.k.a. Quantitative Easing (QE).</strong><br />
The power of printing money whenever you need it would seem like a dream for anyone but, as we all know, with great power comes great responsibility and this is no exception.<br />
Powers and responsibilities regarding QE are the focus of this article &#8211; the fourth of the “Federal Reserve System” series &#8211; and to better comprehend it all, we need to take a quick jump back in time to 2008.<br />
Heck of a jump, I know but, then again, a heck of a year too; stay with me.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Where did it all start</h2>
<p>During the economic crisis of 2008, GDP fell by 4.3% making it the worst recession in 60 years.<br />
In the US alone, 8.8 million people lost their jobs and 6 million houses were repossessed. In Wall Street, the bear market lasted 17 months and was enough to “rob” the S&amp;P 500 of half its value.</p>
<p><strong>On 15 September 2008, Lehman Brothers, the World&#8217;s fourth-largest investment bank, shocked the World by <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2008/BUSINESS/09/15/lehman.bankruptcy/?iid=EL">filing for bankruptcy</a>.</strong> The stock market crashed. People kept losing their jobs. Banks did not trust other banks and businesses and refused to lend to either as well as to the public.</p>
<h3>The recession that changed everything</h3>
<p>2008 was the year (and a half) of the Great Recession but it was also the year the FED made two important, “everything-changing” decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The first decision was made upon the realization that, given the intricacies of “investment globalization” and the amount of capital it represents, <strong>some businesses are, literally, “too big to fail”.</strong><br />
It could be argued that the ramifications of this decision are anti-capitalism and going against “free market spirit” (and it was argued. Animatedly too) but from the FED’s perspective, protecting the economy and maximizing employment is part of the mandate and it must adhere to it… apparently, at all costs.<br />
The concept referred primarily to banks and large insurance companies but there is no real clear restriction and once Pandora’s box is open, there is no putting anything back.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The second decision the FED took might have been viewed as even more drastic and it was made after realizing that the economy risked imploding due to a lack of credit and capital. It lowered its interest rate target from 4.5% at the end of 2007 to just 2% in September 2008 but the cost of credit wasn’t the issue; trust and credibility were.  Banks were determined to avoid any risk amid the turmoil and kept refusing to lend to one another as well as to businesses.  That’s when the FED created a new way to fight a recession and “printed” its way out of it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quantitative Easing (QE)</h3>
<p>In previous articles of this series, we have talked about how the FED can change the interest rate to influence the availability and cost of credit. We know that to do this, the FED raises or lowers the interest it charges to other banks (the Federal Funds Rate) and that this creates a ripple effect that affects the interest rate on all the other loans.</p>
<p><strong>But there is another way to inject capital into the markets and the economy; a faster and more efficient way: Quantitative Easing.</strong></p>
<p>Starting in Japan and used in the US for the first time during the 2008 crisis, the process consists of the Central Bank buying Government bonds and other securities (mostly mortgage-backed) from the open market and paying for them with money that the FED can digitally create themselves.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3425 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/qe.png" alt="QE Quantitative Easing" width="698" height="252" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/qe.png 698w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/qe-300x108.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /></p>
<p><strong>This powerful monetary policy has the double effect of making bonds more expensive (and, therefore, stock more attractive) and injecting a huge amount of money into the economy which provides banks with a greater incentive to lend.</strong></p>
<p>Being able to create money from seemingly thin air &#8211; added to that of manipulating the interest rates &#8211; would undoubtedly seem like the best “superpower” to have to prevent any recession, yet the new policy was, at first, received with anger, criticism and protests with tens of thousands of people marching in the streets.<br />
In 2008, it wasn’t easy &#8211; and it will never be easy &#8211; for the FED and the Government to explain to “The People” why some businesses could not be allowed to fail. It was hard to explain why huge investment banks had to be saved even if considered “the cause of the crisis”. And, it was hard to explain to “ The People” why they had to be forced through a long period of austerity and forced to help those businesses against their will.<br />
It is all very understandable.</p>
<p>However, <strong>the truth is that it is really hard to imagine what the outcome would have been had the FED not intervened.</strong><br />
The American economy is notarially strong and resilient but the pillars that support it can be a little more brittle and need regular management. That’s what the FED does and, as we now know,  that’s the FOMC mandate.</p>
<p><strong>During the Great Recession, the FED QE managed to finance Government&#8217;s guarantee and bailouts worth £498 billion which helped restore trust and sentiment in the market.</strong> The abundance of funds, higher cost of bonds and low-interest rates have all pushed banks to compete with one another for a share of the lending market.</p>
<p>The economy flourished and kept flourishing. GDP increased year after year while the stock market reached a higher and higher level. Unemployment was low and “The People” had higher incomes and started spending more. Way more.<br />
Everything was great. The recession was over and it was the beginning of a bull market that carried on and reached its highest level in 2021.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>There has to be a catch</h3>
<p>Of course there is.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3408 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/since-2008-the-bull-market-never-stopped.jpg" alt="since the 2088 crisis the bull market have never stopped" width="474" height="383" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/since-2008-the-bull-market-never-stopped.jpg 474w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/since-2008-the-bull-market-never-stopped-300x242.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /></p>
<p>It is true; since the 2008 crisis, the bull market and “the happy days” have never stopped but it is also true that neither has the “printing” nor is the ultra-low interest rate.<br />
The FED has continued quantitative easing without interruption since 2007, when it first introduced the policy. <strong>This, many argue, gives the American economy an artificial advantage which may not always reflect real economic growth and can, therefore, result in high inflation, market bubbles and public discontent.</strong></p>
<p>In the article on “<a href="https://.com/inflation/">Inflation</a>”, we have already seen the damages that “too much money” in the system can create to the economy if it’s not equally matched by a growth in GDP. In this article, as well as in the one on “<a href="https://.com/unemployment-rate/">unemployment</a>”, we’ve seen the troubles that can occur when the money in the system is instead not enough.</p>
<p>The Fed’s set of tools is powerful but its job is not simple. The perfect equilibrium of economic bliss is hard to find &#8211; <em>let alone achieve</em> &#8211; in a market that is, by nature, free.</p>
<p>The current economic downturn and high inflation are the newest challenges for the FED.<br />
The money printed in existence and put in circulation during the 2008 recession is shadowed by the money created during the Covid pandemic.<br />
High inflation was to be expected; the war in Europe perhaps wasn’t.<br />
With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the high inflation level post-pandemic &#8211; which was thought to be only temporary &#8211; escalated due to sanctions and major disruption in the supply of energy and food commodities. The Fed had to take hard and unpopular decisions and it certainly did so but… this is a topic for another future article. Stay tuned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here we are on to the third article of the “Federal Reserve System” series.<br />
In the previous articles, we talked about how <a href="https://.com/fomc/">the Federal Reserve System</a> is formed and explained how it and the Government can collaborate to boost the economy and the <a href="https://.com/unemployment-rate/">employment level</a>. We have also described the Federal Reserve System as the organization responsible and entrusted with maximizing employment levels and safeguarding the American economy.<br />
In this new article, <strong>we’ll learn about “inflation” and find out what “safeguarding the American economy” is all about.</strong><br />
Ready? Let’s do it!</p>
<h2>What is Inflation?</h2>
<p>Considering the fact the Fed can easily increase the amount of money circulating within the economy, one might wonder why the Fed doesn’t do just that all the time. After all, if all that’s needed to boost the economy is to inject money into it, why should the Fed ever stop “printing”? Right?</p>
<p><strong>Well, the truth is that “too much money in circulation” is just as bad as “not enough money in circulation”.</strong></p>
<p>Each time the Fed modifies monetary policies in favor of supporting the economy and maximizing employment &#8211; especially when done in tandem with the Government’s fiscal policies &#8211; it has the effect of putting more money into people&#8217;s pockets and companies’ balance sheets. People and Companies have more money to spend and will generally want to do so.<br />
<strong>In a healthy economy, growth in GDP and the availability of products and services are proportional to the growth in private and corporate buying power.</strong> When this is the case, a growing demand is satisfied by a growing supply; The Fed does not need to intervene, free market’s rules apply, the economy remains healthy and everybody’s happy.</p>
<h3><strong>However, when the economy is not so healthy…</strong></h3>
<p>When there are problems in the economy and the Fed feels the need to intervene to prop it up, things can change &#8211; and they can change very quickly.</p>
<p>If the GDP is not growing fast enough, for example, injecting large amounts of money into the system often creates a situation where supply cannot satisfy demand which translates to “more money competing for fewer goods&#8221;. When this happens, naturally, sellers raise prices higher and higher meaning “more dollars are required to pay for the same goods and services”. The currency is de facto devalued and it is this currency devaluation that takes the name of “Inflation”.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3326 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/inflation.jpg" alt="imbalance in the market causes inflation" width="585" height="321" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/inflation.jpg 585w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/inflation-300x165.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></p>
<h2>What can cause inflation?</h2>
<p><strong>The primary reason for inflation is an imbalance in the market that causes unsatisfied demand.</strong></p>
<p>The reasons for that imbalance, however, can be many and they can affect demand as well as supply.<br />
A really bad season for agriculture, for example, often leads to reduced food production. Even with the number of people needing food (demand) unchanged, the short supply would mean higher food prices.<br />
At the beginning of the Covid pandemic, <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/02/1056942">facemasks and hands-spray were known to be sold for exorbitant prices</a> due to sudden increased demand met by “surprised and unprepared” manufacturers. In that situation, it was the demand that increased drastically whilst the supply was (at least at the beginning) the same as it always was.</p>
<p>Some products and services are bought, used and sold across different industries and affect different markets. Demand and supply imbalances in those products and services can cause high prices across the spectrum and all markets.</p>
<p>Now, some fluctuation in price is the norm in a free market; in fact &#8211; and as a trader, you would know &#8211; it’s what makes free markets work.<br />
Steady and measured price increases (inflation)are considered a good sign of a healthy economy but only when matched by increased production as well as increased buying power (higher wages and salaries, lower taxation, cheaper credit for business etc).</p>
<p><strong>In an ideal world with an ideal economy, prices should always be rising in dollar terms but never in “disposable income percentage”.</strong></p>
<h2>How is the Inflation Rate measured and how often is it released?</h2>
<p>Said simply, the Inflation Rate is an indicator of increases in the cost of living and production from one year to another in percentage terms and it expresses variation in purchasing power of businesses and consumers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3332 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/consumer-price-index.jpg" alt="consumer price index and inflation" width="400" height="246" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/consumer-price-index.jpg 400w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/consumer-price-index-300x185.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></p>
<p>In the US, measurements are taken and published by the <strong>Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS)</strong> which produces (amongst others) the CPI and Core CPI inflation figures and the <strong>Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)</strong> which produces the PCE inflation figures instead.</p>
<p>Although varying in nature (more details in the next article of the series), both “bureaux” track prices of an “imaginary shopping basket” always containing the same products and services. Changes in the price of the basket are then interpreted as “inflation” if they are increased or “deflation” if they have decreased. A high level of either is not good for the economy.</p>
<p>Inflation rate releases are a monthly occurrence and one that can create enormous volatility and opportunity in the markets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What can the Government and the Fed do to reduce inflation?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3333 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dismal-track-record.jpg" alt="dismal track record - us inflation" width="650" height="440" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dismal-track-record.jpg 650w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dismal-track-record-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<h3><b>The Government</b></h3>
<p>From the Government&#8217;s point of view, high inflation means high production and import costs that lead to a high cost of living for voters and, consequently, a lower approval rate. And that’s the bottom line.<br />
However, as goods and services prices grow higher and higher, it is only natural that more and more people are no longer able to afford them. This could mean higher Government expenses on welfare which, again, effectively puts even more money into the economy at a time when there might already be too much.</p>
<p><strong>When inflation is caused by an overly high demand &#8211; rather than a restriction in supply as is currently happening &#8211; what the Government and the Fed normally tend to do is to try to slow down the economy.</strong><br />
<strong>When Inflation is caused by an issue in supply, the Government tries to tackle that issue through investments and, on rare occasions, price limiting and control.</strong></p>
<p>When fighting inflation, amongst other things, the Government can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase tax on products and services:</strong> this can help create a curb in demand that can “force” prices to be lowered.</li>
<li><strong>Increase general taxation:</strong> again, this can help reduce the private and corporate spending power and limit demand.</li>
<li><strong>Lower duties on some imports:</strong> with the intent of increasing supply.</li>
<li><strong>Invest:</strong> The government can actively invest in the production of products and services that see their price inflated to increase their supply or in projects that lead to a reduction in demand (i.e. offering incentives to insulate homes to reduce demand for energy)</li>
<li><strong>Reduce public spending:</strong> to reduce money in the system.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"></li>
</ul>
<h3>The Federal Reserve System</h3>
<p>Some Countries have experienced inflation levels such that their currencies have become “useless” virtually overnight. But it doesn’t have to get to those levels to cause any economy to fold and crumble.<br />
An inflation rate of about 2% is considered ideal for a strong economy and making sure that it doesn’t stray too far above or below the target is the Fed’s most important duty. It is directly at the heart of “safeguarding the American economy” and it is so highly valued that it is given priority even over maximizing employment.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3337 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/interest-rates-on-the-rise-1.jpg" alt="Interest rates on the rise cause for inflation" width="650" height="500" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/interest-rates-on-the-rise-1.jpg 650w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/interest-rates-on-the-rise-1-300x231.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p><strong>When inflation reaches levels too high, the Fed can intervene by manipulating the amount of money in the economy to try and solve the problem. It cannot do anything to increase the supply side of things but it has great powers when it comes to “suppressing” demand.</strong></p>
<p>Amongst the different ways the Fed can try and tackle inflation, the two that are most effective are:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Increasing interest rates:</strong> and, by doing so, making money, credit and debts more expensive.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Selling Treasury Bonds to the open market:</strong> by doing so, it literally swaps Bonds for cash which leads to a reduction in money in the system which should translate into lower demand.</li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2>When are Inflation Rates released and why are they important for traders and investors?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/cpi.htm">Inflation rates are released monthly</a> and refer to the previous month. They assume major relevance really only when they start being too high or too low.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3336 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/interest-rates-increases-1.jpg" alt="Interest rate increases" width="650" height="500" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/interest-rates-increases-1.jpg 650w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/interest-rates-increases-1-300x231.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></p>
<p>Traders and investors know that in times of very high inflation (or even deflation), both the government and Fed are bound to intervene.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the steps the Fed needs to take to fight inflation are different &#8211; and opposite in nature &#8211; from those it needs to take when focusing on maximizing employment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Maximizing employment and fighting inflation</strong> are the Federal Reserve System’s mandate and in particular, they are the FOMC’s mandate. Yet, they often seem to stand on two different pans of the same scale. Any adjustment on one side risks provoking a contrary effect on the other. There is no better example of this than what is currently happening in the US and the Worldwide economy.</p>
<p>In the next article of the “Federal Reserve System” series, we’ll talk about Quantitative Easing (QE) and Quantitative Tightening (QT) as part of the “FED’s arsenal” to fight both inflation and unemployment so…</p>
<p>… keep an eye out for it.</p>
<p>I hope this helped.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the first article of the “Federal Reserve System” series, we spoke about the different elements that compose the “Fed” and about the <a href="https://.com/fomc/">FOMC</a> in particular. We have described the Fed’s mandate as “maximizing employment while protecting the Dollar and the American economy” and we’ve also briefly talked of the different ways it has to achieve it.<br />
In this second article, we’ll explain what the Unemployment Rate is and the effect it has on the economy and the market.</p>
<h2>What is the Unemployment Rate?</h2>
<p>Well, put simply the “Unemployment rate” is the way we measure the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the total labor force.<br />
It is one of the most important indicators of an economy’s health; it directly affects it and it is, at the same time, directly affected by it. This is the reason why maximizing employment is a perennial objective of all, the voters, the Fed and the Government.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, <strong>in a healthy and growing economy, the Unemployment Rate tends to be low as Companies have more money to invest and more need to recruit new staff whilst, during economic downturns, Companies are more likely to reduce staff as well as investments causing the Unemployment rate to increase instead.</strong><br />
On the other hand, a high level of employment means that more people have more money to spend. And when people have more money to spend, generally, they spend it. And that’s great for the economy.</p>
<p><strong>A high level of unemployment indicates that the economy is inefficient and under-producing.</strong></p>
<h2>What can the Government and the Fed do to reduce unemployment?</h2>
<h3>The Government</h3>
<p>Politicians who see a high level of employment during their term are more likely to enjoy the approval of both the voters and the <a href="https://.com/analyze-the-market/">financial market</a>. It’s not surprising, therefore, that fighting unemployment is always high up on any political agenda and that the Government has tools of its own to try and “put more people into work”. These includes (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tax cuts or tax benefits to businesses</strong> (to increase Companies&#8217; capital for investments that could partly be spent on recruiting workers).</li>
<li><strong>Tax cuts or tax benefits to the general public</strong> (to increase public spending and Companies’ revenue which, again, can be used to employ workers).</li>
<li><strong>Increase targeted public expenditure</strong> (the government can increase its spending on projects that directly affect the employment levels such as infrastructure projects, apprenticeships and employment subsidies to Companies that recruits a sufficient number of people).</li>
<li><strong>Targeted policies</strong> (such as improving urban and extra-urban mobility, reducing power to the Trade Unions to reduce wage bargaining, improving employment-market flexibility and tightening requirements to receive unemployment-related benefits.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"></li>
</ul>
<h3>The Federal Reserve System</h3>
<p>Whilst the Government is in full control of all Fiscal policies to boost economic growth, the Fed is charged with controlling and deciding on the monetary ones.<br />
The Fed uses its control to effectively “inject money into the economy” to boost employment levels (as part of its mandate) and “withdraw money out the economy” when it needs to reduce inflation (the other part of its mandate).</p>
<p>To increase the money supply in the economy and the employment levels, the Fed has many tools at its disposal, the most common of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Reducing the (short-term) Interest Rate</strong> (this makes “money cheaper”. It allows Companies to borrow more money at a cheaper interest rate which, in turn, allows them to spend more money on recruiting and other investments).</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Open Market Operations</strong> (the Fed buys Treasury Bonds from the open market effectively swapping bonds for cash that is free to enter the market, boost the economy and, in turn, again, increase employment.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Reducing the reserve requirements</strong> (banks have more capital available for lending and investing. This increases the amount of money in circulation which makes it easier for people to buy companies’ products and services and makes it cheaper for companies to borrow money to invest and recruit)</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do Unemployment Rate announcements affect the market?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3299 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Unemployment-Rate.jpg" alt="Unemployment rate federal announcements affect on the market" width="740" height="337" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Unemployment-Rate.jpg 740w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Unemployment-Rate-300x137.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></p>
<p>Unemployment rate figures are released on the first Friday of each month and refer to the prior month.<br />
As well as the Fed and the Government, traders and investors also give particular relevance to the unemployment figures. Low unemployment means that Companies can expect higher demand for their product and services and what kind of investor wouldn’t like that?<br />
Moreover, when companies expect higher demand they are more likely to decide to invest in more staff to increase production. This would further increase employment which, in turn, would further increase demand.</p>
<p>Market sentiment concerning the unemployment rate is better expressed by the inverse relationship it has with S&amp;P500.</p>
<p>When the announced Unemployment Rate is higher than the previous month, the S&amp;P500 price often increases and vice-versa.</p>
<h2>How important are Unemployment Rate announcements for traders?</h2>
<p>The Unemployment Rate is a lagging indicator and gives an insight into changes in the economy that have already occurred rather than into those that are happening now. Nonetheless, the figures can further help to understand current events and predict future market behavior.</p>
<p>Traders need to be particularly aware of increased volatility when the Unemployment Rate announced is different from what the market expected.</p>
<h2>What’s next in the “Federal Reserve System” series?</h2>
<p>So far, we learned that the “Fed” is formed by the seven members of the “Board of Governors”, the twelve Federal Reserve Banks and FOMC, we talked about the Fed’s mandate to maximize employment and safeguard the Dollar and the American economy and examined the tools the Fed has to boost employment level.<br />
In the next article, the focus will be on <strong>“Inflation”; the other side of the coin.</strong><br />
Now that we know how the Fed has the power of “creating” capital and inject it into the economy, we will discuss what happens when <strong>“a lot of money in the economy becomes too much money in the economy”</strong>, we’ll find out what the Fed can do to prevent it and protect currency and economy and you’ll understand why it’s so important for traders and investors.</p>
<p>As always, I hope this helped!</p>
