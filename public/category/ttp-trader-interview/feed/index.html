<p>Michael T., 31 years old, from the USA.</p>
<p>Michael has successfully passed our <a href="https://.com/#packages">Ultra Buying Power program,</a> and he is now TTP&#8217;s funded trader managing a $260K account, or as we call it, he is a true “Stock Star”.</p>
<p>Every time he reaches 5 consecutive winning days, we will boost his buying power and max exposure.</p>
<p>We spoke with Michael about his trading plan, insights, and lessons gained while trading in the markets and our platform as a funded trader.</p>
<h2>Michael&#8217;s evaluation statistics</h2>

<h3>Q&amp;A With Michael</h3>
<h4>Tell us a little bit about yourself</h4>
<p>My name is Michael. I have degrees in finance, economics, and accounting. Went the trader route on my search for freedom and wealth. I gained my passion for markets during the medical marijuana penny stock boom around 2012 and haven’t looked back.</p>
<h4>How long have you been trading?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a full-time Trader for 11 years</p>
<h4>Briefly describe your trading plan and how it contributes to your success</h4>
<p>Every day I am looking at my watchlists, <a href="https://.com/pick-the-hottest-stock/">scanners</a>, <a href="https://.com/understanding-news/">news</a>, internet, and trading friends ideas to see if there are any of my setups available to trade. This has helped bring some consistency during ever changing market conditions.</p>
<p><a href="https://.com/#packages"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5949" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="126" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner.jpg 728w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner-300x52.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></a></p>
<h4>How did you adjust risk management to your trading personality?</h4>
<p>By allowing myself to risk more on high quality trades while still having a max loss and usually trading at least a few ideas a day.</p>
<h4>Describe a key moment in your trading career</h4>
<p>I worked at a prop firm in 2015-2016. My only trading strategy at the time was not working and I blew up my account there. That forced me to grow as a trader and figure out what went wrong. It also forced me to really think about how I could set myself up for success in the long run in this business. For me, that involved doing things outside of trading so that I could learn without relying on income from trading to pay my bills.</p>
<h4>How long did it take for you to become a consistent trader, and what aspects did you change for that?</h4>
<p>5 years. Hardest part was scraping money together to keep trading.</p>
<h4>What is your mental/psychological strength, and how did you develop it</h4>
<p>Stress management. We are the ones who beat ourselves up and add more stress to our lives, which makes it hard to fix, but is also empowering. Taking ownership of this has been more important than learning anything new about trading and markets.</p>
<h4>What was your strategy for successfully passing the evaluation phase?</h4>
<p>I traded a pretty wide variety of ideas, both long and short, so I can’t put it on one thing.</p>
<h4>How is trading for Funded Trades  Now For You different from trading by yourself?</h4>
<p>You have resources at your disposal to help you learn and by being a funded trader you have the ability to withdraw some profits while still growing your account/keeping the same amount of buying power.</p>
<h4>What would you recommend to someone who is just starting with us?</h4>
<p>Find the right direction on your path. I would recommend different things to different people depending on their circumstances.</p>
<h4>Share online resources that were/are significant in your trading development. Names and links are appreciated.</h4>
<p>Reminiscences of a stock operator is my favorite trading book as it came recommended by my former prop firm bosses. Countless books, podcasts, articles, and working with other traders have also been key.</p>

<h2>&#8220;Don’t swing for the fences. You’ve got a lot of time!&#8221;</h2>
<p>Patricia has successfully passed our <a href="https://.com/#packages">Super Buying Power program,</a> and she is now TTP&#8217;s funded trader managing a $80K account, or as we call it, she is a true “Stock Star”.</p>
<p>Every time she reaches 5 consecutive winning days, we will boost her buying power and max exposure.</p>
<p>We spoke with Patricia about her trading plan, insights, and lessons gained while trading in the markets and our platform as a funded trader.</p>
<h2>Patricia&#8217;s evaluation statistics</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-6164 size-large" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Patricia-S-1-828x1024.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="791" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Patricia-S-1-828x1024.jpg 828w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Patricia-S-1-243x300.jpg 243w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Patricia-S-1-768x950.jpg 768w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Patricia-S-1.jpg 858w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>Q&amp;A With Patricia</h3>
<h4>Tell us a little bit about yourself</h4>
<p>My name is Patricia. I’m originally from Germany but came to the USA in 2008 to run track. I lived in NYC for almost 10 years before I moved to the Westcoast.<br />
I am also the mom of a one year old. Trying to get back into competitive running.</p>
<h4>How long have you been trading?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a part-time Trader for 1.5 years</p>
<h4>Briefly describe your trading plan and how it contributes to your success</h4>
<p>I’m a short biased trader regarding small caps. In the Morning I am looking at my scanners and make a plan based on fundamentals and technicals.<br />
Then I place my order with the appropriate risk management and usually step away.</p>
<h4>Share with us a challenge you faced in your trading career and how you overcame it</h4>
<p>I started trading when I was 6 months pregnant.<br />
It was quite challenging with a newborn to trade in the mornings. She usually woke up 4 times at night and especially when the market opened, haha.<br />
I definitely had to really focus and multitask during these short hours in the mornings. That was definitely a huge challenge!</p>
<p><a href="https://.com/#packages"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5949" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="126" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner.jpg 728w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner-300x52.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></a></p>
<h4>How did you adjust risk management to your trading personality?</h4>
<p>I’m an impatient person. Trading taught me to step away and not focus on the fluctuations. It drove myself crazy!</p>
<h4>Describe a key moment in your trading career</h4>
<p>adjusting risk management to my trading was definitely a key moment!</p>
<h4>How long did it take for you to become a consistent trader, and what aspects did you change for that?</h4>
<p>I’d say a year . Looking into fundamentals AND technicals and not just scalp everything right and left.</p>
<h4>What is your mental/psychological strength, and how did you develop it</h4>
<p>I’m quick in decision making once a stock fits my criteria. I don’t dwell in should I or should I not. By the time I’m dwelling, the stock already moved too much.<br />
Also the fact I’m not looking at the screen much once my trade has been placed.<br />
Emotions are shut out at that point.</p>
<h4>What was your strategy for successfully passing the evaluation phase?</h4>
<p>Taking profits early and applying tight risk management.</p>
<h4>How is trading for Funded Trades  Now For You different from trading by yourself?</h4>
<p>It makes me more accountable with TTP. It’s a full support system and I love it.</p>
<h4>What would you recommend to someone who is just starting with us?</h4>
<p>Start small, don’t swing for the fences. You’ve got a lot of time!</p>
<h4>Share online resources that were/are significant in your trading development. Names and links are appreciated.</h4>
<p>I’ve been listening to hundreds of audiobooks and podcasts.<br />
That came in handy because my baby had to take lots of naps and she liked car naps in the newborn phase. So I basically drove around for two hours at a time and listened to lots of things.<br />
“Market Wizards”, “Trading in the Zone”, “Best loser wins” and podcasts such as “<a href="https://chatwithtraders.com/">Chat with Traders</a>” were my go to where I actually heard about you:)</p>
<h4><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Would you like to share anything else with us?&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:311296,&quot;17&quot;:0,&quot;18&quot;:0,&quot;21&quot;:0}">Would you like to share anything else with us?</span></h4>
<p>Just super stoked to work with you!</p>

<p>Clement has successfully passed our <a href="https://.com/#packages">Extra Buying Power program,</a> and he is now TTP&#8217;s funded trader managing a $20K account, or as we call it, he is a true “Stock Star”.</p>
<p>Every time he reaches 5 consecutive winning days, we will boost his buying power and max exposure.</p>
<p>We spoke with Clement about his trading plan, insights, and lessons gained while trading in the markets and our platform as a funded trader.</p>
<h2>Clement&#8217;s evaluation statistics</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-6056 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/clement.jpg" alt="" width="944" height="1010" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/clement.jpg 944w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/clement-280x300.jpg 280w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/clement-768x822.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px" /></p>
<h3>Q&amp;A&#8217;s With Clement</h3>
<h4>Tell us a little bit about yourself</h4>
<p>My name is Clement. I&#8217;m a registered nurse and I like playing basketball.</p>
<h4>How long have you been trading?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a part-time Trader for 2 years</p>
<h4>Briefly describe your trading plan and how it contributes to your success</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m a short-biased trader and mainly focus on penny stocks with a high risk of dilution. But everything leading to success is about risk management and trading psychology. Stay humble and stay hungry for the market.</p>
<h4>Share with us a challenge you faced in your trading career and how you overcame it</h4>
<p>There was a huge drawdown sometimes in your career because of the market cycle. I just kept backtesting my strategy and let the statistics strengthen my conviction about the way I traded.</p>
<p><a href="https://.com/#packages"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5949" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="126" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner.jpg 728w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner-300x52.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></a></p>
<h4>How did you adjust risk management to your trading personality?</h4>
<p>I set a max loss with my broker, which is about 2% of my account size. So when it hits, just walk away and enjoy my life with family.</p>
<h4>Describe a key moment in your trading career</h4>
<p>The key moment was when I realized trading psychology is the most important part of trading when reading the book called &#8220;Trading in the Zone&#8221;. After that, I focused on risk management instead of making complicated trading strategies.</p>
<h4>How long did it take for you to become a consistent trader, and what aspects did you change for that?</h4>
<p>I think it took me a year to become a consistent trader. The way I changed was just to focus on risk management and be patient for a good setup instead of doing lots of random trade</p>
<h4>What is your mental/psychological strength, and how did you develop it</h4>
<p>Never be satisfied with your current situation. Persevere with your goal in order to improve every aspect of your trading.</p>
<h4>What was your strategy for successfully passing the evaluation phase?</h4>
<p>Keep losing tight and let the winners go. focus only on 1 or 2 best setups in my playbook.</p>
<h4>How is trading for Funded Trades  Now For You different from trading by yourself?</h4>
<p>I really appreciate the tight risk management of TTP.</p>
<h4>What would you recommend to someone who is just starting with us?</h4>
<p>Simply, Yes.</p>
<h4>Share online resources that were/are significant in your trading development. Names and links are appreciated.</h4>

<p>Richard W., 49 years old, from Singapore.</p>
<p>Richard has successfully passed our <a href="https://.com/#packages">Mini Buying Power program,</a> and he is now TTP&#8217;s funded trader managing a $20K account, or as we call it, he is a true “Stock Star”.</p>
<p>Every time he reaches 5 consecutive winning days, we will boost his buying power and max exposure.</p>
<p>We spoke with Richard about his trading plan, insights, and lessons gained while trading in the markets and our platform as a funded trader.</p>
<h2>Richard&#8217;s evaluation statistics</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-6015 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Richard-W.jpg" alt="" width="944" height="1010" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Richard-W.jpg 944w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Richard-W-280x300.jpg 280w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Richard-W-768x822.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px" /></p>
<h3>Q&amp;A&#8217;S With Richard</h3>
<h4>Tell us a little bit about yourself</h4>
<p>I am Richard from Singapore. I enjoy trading, exercising, and living life on my own terms.</p>
<h4>How long have you been trading?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a Swing Trader for 5.5 years</p>
<h4>Briefly describe your trading plan and how it contributes to your success</h4>
<p>I am a short-seller who trades day gainer(s) with high volume. I would wait for reversal setup to be completed before entering the market. Patience and discipline are vital to success.</p>
<h4>Share with us a challenge you faced in your trading career and how you overcame it</h4>
<p>I was a slow learner in acquiring my trading competency and it took me a long while before becoming profitable. Believing in myself, staying persistent, and never giving up helped me to overcome my unprofitable stint.</p>
<p><a href="https://.com/#packages"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5949" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="126" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner.jpg 728w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner-300x52.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></a></p>
<h4>How did you adjust risk management to your trading personality?</h4>
<p>I believe each play has a different risk. As such, I would define the risk of each play before entering the market. With the defined risk, I set the stop limit for each of my positions accordingly. This way, every risk undertaken is an informed decision. Even if the trade turns out unprofitable, I know it is a probable outcome that is within my level of acceptance.</p>
<h4>Describe a key moment in your trading career</h4>
<p>My key moment is the epiphany that funded trading is the way to go for my trading endeavor.<br />
As a funded trader, I could detach my emotions from my trade amidst price fluctuations while waiting for the play to pan out in my favor.</p>
<h4>How long did it take for you to become a consistent trader, and what aspects did you change for that?</h4>
<p>It took me 5 long years to become a consistent trader. For that, I have become as disciplined and patient as I need to be. Over and above, I constantly keep in tab with the ever-changing market.</p>
<h4>What is your mental/psychological strength, and how did you develop it</h4>
<p>Tenacity. I love and enjoy trading, and these help me not to give up during the toughest times.<br />
Studying the trade(s) of the day for learning lessons. Watching markets daily, helps develop belief in intuition, because the same things happen over and over again.</p>
<h4>What was your strategy for successfully passing the evaluation phase?</h4>
<p>Utilize a tested &amp; proven strategy that is aligned to my personality. Minding my position risk and weaving it into my trading plan are pivotal to passing the evaluation phase.</p>
<h4>How is trading for Funded Trades  Now For You different from trading by yourself?</h4>
<p>I am able to detach my emotions from my trades. Further, funded trading requires no capital of my own other than the program fee. Over and above, funded trading could be scaled rapidly when done right.</p>
<h4>What would you recommend to someone who is just starting with us?</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>&#8220;Having a risk manager really helped me make sure I was making sound decisions&#8221;</h2>
<p>Terrell W., 21 years old, from the USA.</p>
<p>Terrell has successfully passed our <a href="https://.com/#packages">Extra Buying Power program,</a> and he is now TTP&#8217;s funded trader managing a $160K account, or as we call it, he is a true “Stock Star”.</p>
<p>Every time he reaches 5 consecutive winning days, we will boost his buying power and max exposure.</p>
<p>We spoke with Terrell about his trading plan, insights, and lessons gained while trading in the markets and our platform as a funded trader.</p>
<h2>Terrell&#8217;s evaluation statistics</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5987 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image.png" alt="" width="944" height="678" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image.png 944w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-300x215.png 300w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-768x552.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px" /></p>
<h3>Q&amp;A&#8217;s With Terrell</h3>
<h4>Tell us a little bit about yourself</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m 21 years old. I live in the United States, and I&#8217;ve always had a passion for the markets from a young age.</p>
<h4>How long have you been trading?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trading full-time for a little over 5 years.</p>
<h4>Briefly describe your trading plan and how it contributes to your success</h4>
<p>My trading plan is to trade only a few key setups on the most volatile stocks of the day. I will typically get up around 7:00 AM market time but may get up earlier depending on the scan from the previous after-hours session. This allows me to take advantage of the stocks setting up for moves later on towards the open.</p>
<h4>Share with us a challenge you faced in your trading career and how you overcame it</h4>
<p>I struggled with taking my stops when the price hit that level. What really helped me overcome this was looking back at all my trades where I didn&#8217;t follow my stop, and just showing myself that in the long term not respecting my risk loses me money.</p>
<p><a href="https://.com/#packages"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5949" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="126" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner.jpg 728w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/banner-300x52.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></a></p>
<h4>How did you adjust risk management to your trading personality?</h4>
<p>I prefer to know if I&#8217;m wrong not long after opening a trade, so I like to enter in key areas where I can find out relatively soon. The amount I&#8217;m willing to risk percentage-wise will vary depending on the setup, but generally I prefer to keep tight stops at key levels.</p>
<h4>Describe a key moment in your trading career</h4>
<p>A key moment in my trading career was in 2020 when I had my best months ever in the early part of the year, but ended up giving it all back in the following months. This was a huge milestone in my journey because it taught me it doesn&#8217;t matter how good your edge is if you don&#8217;t exercise risk management.</p>
<h4>How long did it take for you to become a consistent trader, and what aspects did you change for that?</h4>
<p>It took about 2 years before I found some consistency trading OTC breakouts, but when the OTC runners stopped coming around there weren&#8217;t any opportunities to take. I started day trading at the beginning of this year, and it took about 6 months before I began to show consistency. One of the key things that helped me was reviewing my old trades to figure out exactly what setups I was taking, and improving upon how I trade them.</p>
<h4>What is your mental/psychological strength, and how did you develop it</h4>
<p>I believe my biggest mental strength when it comes to trading is my ability for pattern recognition and having a strong understanding of price action and volume. I developed this skill from just being active in the market for several years.</p>
<h4>What was your strategy for successfully passing the evaluation phase?</h4>
<p>My strategy for passing the evaluation was to cut out the subpar setups focusing on only 1 to 2 setups, and maximizing when those setups offer good R:R.</p>
<h4>How is trading for Funded Trades  Now For You different from trading by yourself?</h4>
<p>Having a risk manager really helped me make sure I was making sound decisions. Also, if I&#8217;m not performing my best on the day, having my ability to trade paused can be crucial in making sure I don&#8217;t start overtrading.</p>
<h4>What would you recommend to someone who is just starting with us?</h4>
<p>To any traders new to the program, I would suggest just taking it slow, and use small size in the beginning. Find what market and setups best suit you, and really earn the right to size up, by building out a cushion.</p>
<h4>Share online resources that were/are significant in your trading development. Names and links are appreciated.</h4>
<p>I would suggest watching Chat with Traders Podcast, and <a href="https://www.youtu.com/channel/UCg3B_joekBGJ1s_4fRjsMKA">SMB Capital youtu videos</a>. Very good insights for all types of trading in both.</p>

<p>Boris U., 48 years old, from the United States.</p>
<p>Boris has successfully passed our <a href="https://.com/#packages">Extra Buying Power program,</a> and he is now TTP&#8217;s funded trader managing a $160K account, or as we call it, he is a true “Stock Star”.</p>
<p>Every time he reaches 5 consecutive winning days, we will boost his buying power and max exposure.</p>
<p>We spoke with Boris about his trading plan, insights, and lessons gained while trading in the markets and our platform as a funded trader.</p>
<h2>Boris&#8217;s evaluation statistics</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5867 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Boris-U.jpg" alt="" width="944" height="678" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Boris-U.jpg 944w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Boris-U-300x215.jpg 300w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Boris-U-768x552.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Q&amp;A&#8217;s With Boris</h3>
<h4>Tell us a little bit about yourself</h4>
<p>My name is Boris Urman. I had been living in Israel for 16 years, then moved to the United States. I am a short-bias day trader.</p>
<h4>How long have you been trading?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trading for over 8 years</p>
<h4>Briefly describe your trading plan and how it contributes to your success</h4>
<p>I trade mostly in Premarket hours and started to focus on stocks over 20% change. I looked at a daily chart to determine key levels (resistance/support) and draw on intraday chart premarket levels. When the market opens, I  try to focus on spikes with big volume and wait for approximately 15 minutes.</p>
<h4>Share with us a challenge you faced in your trading career and how you overcame it</h4>
<p>In the beginning, there was no understanding of what I was doing. I only thought about money, and only over the years I begin to think about the process. The moment I began thinking about the process, I started to have some successful trades and developed consistency.</p>
<p><a href="https://.com/#packages"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3474 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2.jpg" alt="ttp - a prop firm for Forex Traders" width="960" height="120" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2.jpg 960w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2-300x38.jpg 300w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2-768x96.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></p>
<h4>How did you adjust risk management to your trading personality?</h4>
<p>My risk management is how I feel comfortable with position size.</p>
<h4>Describe a key moment in your trading career</h4>
<p>When I had my first big loss. Being able to recover was crucial to develop a new strategy to minimize losses.</p>
<h4>How long did it take for you to become a consistent trader, and what aspects did you change for that?</h4>
<p>It took me 4-5 years to become a consistent trader.</p>
<h4>What is your mental/psychological strength, and how did you develop it</h4>
<p>My mental and psychological strength depends on my position size.</p>
<h4>What was your strategy for successfully passing the evaluation phase?</h4>
<p>My strategy is to trade only small caps.</p>
<h4>How is trading for Funded Trades  Now For You different from trading by yourself?</h4>
<p>It’s different because we trade stocks with no need to care about locates so that I can short any of the 12,000 stocks.</p>
<p>The risk management. If I already understand that the stock is going against me, then I am automatically closed by the daily loss parameter, and I have no temptation to add more and, accordingly, get a larger loss. I consider this an advantage of Funded Trades  Now For You.</p>
<h4>What would you recommend to someone who is just starting with us?</h4>
<p>Trade small position size for start.</p>

<h3>Q&amp;A&#8217;s With Dan</h3>
<h4>Tell us a little bit about yourself</h4>
<p>I am 31 years old and now live on the central Coast of California after moving around the globe for a good chunk of my life.</p>
<p>A friend of mine showed me what stocks were when I was 16 and I’ve been hooked ever since, always following the markets and trying to learn new strategies even at times when I didn’t have the means to actively trade.</p>
<h4>How long have you been trading?</h4>
<p>I’ve been trading on and off for quite a few years now but decided to take it seriously and go full time about 3 years now.</p>
<h4>Briefly describe your trading plan and how it contributes to your success</h4>
<p>Every morning I start by scanning the pre-market for the biggest movers of the day. I mostly trade micro/small cap stocks that have a lot of volume.<br />
One of my main strategies is to find stocks that have had an early morning breakout but are still only at the beginning of their upwards trend for the day. I normally wait for a pull-back off the high of day and look for the retest of that high and how strong the upwards trend was. Once I’ve identified that the chart looks good and there’s significant enough volume I will take the trade.</p>
<h4>Share with us a challenge you faced in your trading career and how you overcame it</h4>
<p>The biggest challenge for me was what I feel most traders face and that is risk management. I knew I had a good understanding of the markets and the strategies that worked for me but I would enter trades with too much of my portfolio and not a clear exit strategy once things didn’t go my way.<br />
It took me a while to finally understand that I need to set clear profit targets with acceptable win to loss ratios. Based on their volatility and potential for gains or loses I needed to adjust how much I would enter each trade with for each stock rather than enter each one with the same amount each time and set clear win/loss ratios. Once this was established I had a way of entering or exiting trades that was automatic.</p>

<h4>How did you adjust risk management to your trading personality?</h4>
<p>I started to adjust my position size based on the volatility of a stock, starting off a lot smaller and scaling into the positions instead of going in with all at once.</p>
<h4>Describe a key moment in your trading career</h4>
<p>Once I become consistent and realized I could do this for a living</p>
<h4>How long did it take for you to become a consistent trader, and what aspects did you change for that?</h4>
<p>It took over 3 years for me to finally become consistent after I understood risk management and position scaling.</p>
<h4>What is your mental/psychological strength, and how did you develop it</h4>
<p>Persistence. Once I want something I don’t give up, no matter how many times I fail. And I’ve failed a lot with trading but I want to be successful at it more than anything.</p>
<h4>What was your strategy for successfully passing the evaluation phase?</h4>
<p>Scaling into the positions, adding to the winners. Let the market dictate what you should do. During this time I shorted a lot more than I usually do.</p>
<h4>How is trading for Funded Trades  Now For You different from trading by yourself?</h4>
<p>You’re not risking your own capital, that alleviates a lot of the pressure, along with the built in stops and drawdowns it helps prevent major account blow ups.</p>
<h4>What would you recommend to someone who is just starting with us?</h4>
<p>Spend time getting used to the platform and how the stops work.</p>
<h4>Share online resources that were/are significant in your trading development. Names and links are appreciated.</h4>

I established a system that would help me get in and out of the market without much second guessing. I created a system that tells me how many shares to buy based on the price of a stock.

<h3>Q&amp;A&#8217;s With Alexander</h3>
<h4>Tell us a little bit about yourself.</h4>
<p>I live in the Midwest with my wife and new baby.  As a part-time trader, I work remote and trade mornings.</p>
<h4>How long have you been trading?</h4>
<p>I’ve been trading for <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;3 years&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:513,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0}">3 years.</span></p>
<h4>Briefly describe your trading plan and how it contributes to your success.</h4>
<p>I narrow down my focus to 3-5 in play names on the day, and by the open, I&#8217;m really only looking at 1-2 names. I&#8217;ve written down probabilities of what I think can happen on the open and my general bias in the stock. Then, when I execute, I look for opportunities where the momentum of the stock turns from either over-extension to upside or the downside. I also like to play opening range breakouts in names with strong catalyst as well as multi- day breakouts.</p>
<h4>Share with us a challenge you faced in your trading career and how you overcame it.</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve had difficulties trading on tilt and have allowed losers to grow and compound. I can usually put together great string of winning trades but then blow up trading on tilt. Risk parameters have always been challenging. FTNFU has helped me with this immensely</p>

<h4>How did you adjust risk management to your trading personality?</h4>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I love to capture the big move and have trouble taking profit on small winners. This was something I had to adjust in order to build momentum and string wins together. Then when I do capture a big move, I trade around a core position and pay myself along the way. It is too difficult to go all in and all out. That is an easy way to stop out over and over. The commissions also add up quickly and eat into profit. &quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:513,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0}">I love to capture the big move and have trouble taking profit on small winners.

<h4>Describe a key moment in your trading career.</h4>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;A key movement for me was taking a large loss and being able to recognize that the opportunity was still there and potentially even greater the next day. I made back the loss and then some. Taught me that trading is all about keeping yourself in the game. The opportunities will always come, but if you blow up or stop out, you wont be there to take these trades. &quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:513,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0}">A key movement for me was taking a large loss and being able to recognize that the opportunity was still there and potentially even greater the next day.

<h4>How long did it take for you to become a consistent trader, and what aspects did you change for that?</h4>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;I am still in the process of becoming consistent, but a huge leap in the process was limiting my biggest losses. I have always been able to find the right stocks to trade and have executed well, but have a tendency to give back gains or overtrade. Creating rules to limit these issues has been the biggest change. &quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:513,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0}">I am still in the process of becoming consistent, but a huge leap in the process was limiting my biggest losses.

<h4>What is your mental/psychological strength, and how did you develop it</h4>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Mentally it is about being open and honest with your weaknesses and recognize where you are losing money. I think everyone can find ways to make money in the market but it is more difficult to see all the ways that you consistently lose money and work to change those habits. &quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:513,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0}">Mentally it is about being open and honest with your weaknesses and recognize where you are losing money.

<h4>What was your strategy for successfully passing the evaluation phase?</h4>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Trading the most in play stocks that were seeing the highest retail participation. Looking for asymmetric opportunities that offered very high risk/reward in short term.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:513,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0}">Trading the most in play stocks that were seeing the highest retail participation.

<h4>How is trading for Funded Trades  Now For You different from trading by yourself?</h4>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Larger buying power and set risk controls. The risk management is the biggest thing. The execution is also different. In TTP, I almost always have to cross the spread to get filled which makes things difficult if trading a stock with spread greater than 0.10. Makes it almost never worth it to market order.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:513,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0}">Larger buying power and set risk controls.
