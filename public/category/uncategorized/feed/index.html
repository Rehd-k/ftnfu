<h3>Tell us a little bit about yourself.</h3>
<p>I am a South African living and working in Switzerland. I like doing mechanical work in my spare time and trading of course.</p>
<h3>How long have you been trading?</h3>
<p>From my first live trading account about one and half years. I am a part-time trader.</p>
<h3>Briefly describe your Trading Plan and how it contributes to your success.</h3>
<p>Doing pre-market prep. My goals I have for the week.</p>
<h3>Share with us a challenge you faced in your trading career and how you overcame it</h3>
<p>Blowing account with one trade after a few good weeks of trading. Was hard to come back from this one as all the hard work I have put in was lost in just one trade. I took a few days of from trading and tried to build up confidence again that anything is possible. Switch to demo trading after that, and that really helped as well</p>

<h3>How did you adjust risk management to your trading personality?</h3>
<p>Risk management has never been my strong point. That is one of the reasons I have started with TTP, as they do the risk management for you</p>
<h3>Describe a key moment in your trading career</h3>
<p>It Must have been my first $1000 trade. Felt amazing!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-4068 size-full aligncenter" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ivan-O-Graph-1.jpg" alt="$20K funded trader With Funded Trades  Now For You" width="741" height="744" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ivan-O-Graph-1.jpg 741w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ivan-O-Graph-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ivan-O-Graph-1-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /></p>
<h3>How long did it take for you to become a consistent trader, and what aspects did you change for that?</h3>
<p>Only recently became consistent, so also nearly one and half years.</p>
<h3>What is your mental/psychological strength, and how did you develop it</h3>
<p>My best psychological strength is making a recovery from a bad loss. I can build up confidence quite quickly again, attacking the market the next day</p>
<h3>What was your strategy for successfully passing the evaluation phase?</h3>
<p>Mostly halt trading and Short selling.</p>
<h3>How is trading for Funded Trades  Now For You different from trading by yourself?</h3>
<p>The resources FTNFU provides. And also for me that they manage your risk.</p>
<h3>What would you recommend to someone who is just starting with us?</h3>
<p>Do not go all in from the beginning. First, get to know the program and find out what is working for you or not</p>
<h3>Share online resources that were/are significant in your trading development. Names and links are appreciated.</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.trade-ideas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trade Ideas</a> and <a href="https://trendspider.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trend Spider</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Arbnor&#8217;s advice: Scale in and scale out to help you control the risk</h2>
<p>Arbnor T, From the US.</p>
<p>Arbnor has successfully passed our <a href="https://.com/">Extra Trading Capital</a> program and is now one of TTP&#8217;s funded traders, or as we call it, he is a true &#8220;Stock Star.&#8221;<br />
Every time he reaches 5 consecutive winning days, we will boost his buying power and max exposure.</p>
<p>We spoke with Arbnor about his trading plan, insights, and lessons gained while trading in the markets and our platform as a funded trader. In this interview he discusses his trading journey, strategy, and success. He started trading in January 2021, after studying for a year and a half, and has since made $160K as a funded trader.</p>
<h2>Watch The Interview With Arbnor</h2>
<p><iframe title="This Setup For Stocks Under $20 Made Arbnor A $160K FTNFU Funded Trader" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtu.com/embed/nASNfRePhIA?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>Starting Out</h2>
<p>Arbnor moved to Waco, Texas, to focus on his studies and trading. He hit the books and DVDs for eight months before starting paper trading for another eight to nine months. By putting in the work, he was able to transition from paper trading to trading with real money smoothly.</p>
<h2>Trading Strategy</h2>
<p>Arbnor focuses primarily on short selling small-cap stocks,<strong> typically under $20 and over 50 cents</strong>. He looks for overextension, where a stock goes from one dollar to nine dollars in one day or a few days. Once he starts to see signs of weakness, such as a mean red candle or buying volume not moving the chart anymore, he will start to short sell.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3474 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2.jpg" alt="ttp - a prop firm for Forex Traders" width="960" height="120" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2.jpg 960w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2-300x38.jpg 300w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2-768x96.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<h2>Determining the Top</h2>
<p>When asked how he determines the top, Arbnor states that <strong>it&#8217;s an art and a science</strong>. He looks for multiple indicators of weakness, such as red candles, volume buying not moving the chart anymore, and signs of topping off. He doesn&#8217;t know for sure if it&#8217;s the top, but <strong>the more indicators he sees, the more confident he is in the trade</strong>.</p>
<h2>Scaling into Positions</h2>
<p>Arbnor used to go all-in on a trade, but he has since learned to scale into positions. By scaling in, he gets better averages and can manage risk better.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Arbnor&#8217;s trading journey is a testament to the importance of putting in the work and developing a strategy that works for you. His focus on short selling small-cap stocks under $20 and over 50 cents has proven successful, and he has been able to make $160K as a funded trader. His willingness to adapt and learn has helped him to become a successful trader and a valuable member of Trade Pool.</p>

<p>Michael E, From the US.</p>
<p>Michael has successfully passed our <a href="https://.com/">Extra Trading Capital</a> program and is now one of FTNFU’s funded traders, or as we call it, he is a true “Stock Star.”<br />
Every time he reaches 5 consecutive winning days, we will boost his buying power and max exposure.</p>
<p>We spoke with Michael about his trading plan, insights, and lessons gained while trading in the markets and our platform as a funded trader.</p>

<h2>Watch The Interview With Michael</h2>
<p><iframe title="$10,000 Profit  - Trading Stocks with Funded Trades  Now For You - Interview with $160K Funded Trader Michael E." width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtu.com/embed/dYmRdUFcBLo?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Trading Journey</h2>
<p>In the interview Michael discusses his journey and trading strategies. He has been trading for five to six years, learning from <a href="https://www.youtu.com/@TimothySykesTrader">Timothy Sykes</a> and his student Tim Grittani. He focuses exclusively on short selling penny stocks, looking for over-extended top percentage gainers and trading the first red day or shorting into previous resistance levels.</p>
<p>When asked about how he determines when to sell or buy, Michael explains that he never knows for sure when the top or bottom is in, but looks for indicators like hard cracks and resistance levels. He also emphasizes the importance of cutting losses quickly, as taught by Sykes and Grittani.</p>
<h2>Experience with Funded Trades  Now For You</h2>
<p>Michael praises the program, calling it &#8220;monumental&#8221; and a great opportunity for traders to prove their skills and gain access to capital to make profits. He mentions that he had to <a href="https://.com/fine-tune-your-trading-strategy/">adjust his trading strategy</a> to scale into his positions, but sees the benefits of doing so.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Overall, the interview provides valuable insights into the mindset and strategies of a successful funded trader. Michael&#8217;s emphasis on <a href="https://.com/risk-management-trading/">risk management</a> and cutting losses quickly is a common thread throughout the interview, highlighting its importance in trading.

<p>The interview could be beneficial to both experienced traders looking to learn from a successful funded trader and newer traders looking to gain insight into the trading world. Michael&#8217;s focus on penny stocks and short selling may be especially relevant to those looking to trade volatile small-cap stocks.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>&#8220;<em>Low your position size on trades where you are not extremely confident in</em>&#8221; That’s Domingo&#8217;s Advice.</h2>
<p>Domingo C, From the US.</p>
<p>Domingo has successfully passed our <a href="https://.com/">Super Trading Capital</a> program and is now one of TTP&#8217;s funded traders, or as we call it, &#8220;Stock Star.&#8221;<br />
Every time he reaches 5 consecutive winning days, we will boost his buying power and max exposure.</p>
<p>We spoke with Domingo about his trading plan, insights, and lessons gained while trading in the markets and our platform as a funded trader.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Watch The Interview With Domingo</h2>
<p><iframe title="Stock Trader Domingo Turned $300 into a $80,000 funded account - Funded Trades  Now For You Fund!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtu.com/embed/EOewF5v6A1w?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Domingo has successfully turned his initial investment of $300 into a fully-funded trading account of $80,000. In this interview Domingo discusses his trading journey, strategies, and the type of trader he is.</strong></p>
<p>Domingo started trading about a year ago with his own money as he was looking for an alternative to his nine-to-five job. He initially started looking into the market and learning about different stocks, including big tech names like Apple and Tesla. Over time, he transitioned into trading ETFs, particularly 3x ETFs and semiconductor ETFs, as they tend to move more than individual stocks.</p>
<p><a href="https://ftnfu.com"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3474 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2.jpg" alt="ttp - a prop firm for Forex Traders" width="960" height="120" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2.jpg 960w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2-300x38.jpg 300w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2-768x96.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></p>
<p>Domingo is an <a href="https://.com/types-of-day-trading-strategies/">aggressive trader</a> who looks for strong moves and good setups. He has moved away from using technical indicators like MACD, RSI, and moving averages and now trades based on price action and support and resistance levels. He believes that<strong> the market has shifted and technical indicators are not as reliable as they once were.</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to his <a href="https://.com/types-of-day-trading-strategies/">trading strategy</a>, Domingo looks for higher highs and higher lows and checks if it&#8217;s over a B-WOP. If it is, then he considers it a good trade as it&#8217;s a strong position. He has a specific plan and set of rules that he applies to his trades, such as a minimum one-to-two ratio between his stop loss and take profit. He is typically looking for a 50 cent to 75 cent profit on a trade and a 30 cent loss.</p>
<p>Funded Trades  Now For You Fund is a trading community that provides traders with the capital to trade. Once traders pass an evaluation process, they are given a funded trading account to work with. <strong>Domingo is now a funded trader with Funded Trades  Now For You Fund</strong>, having successfully passed the evaluation process.</p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>Domingo&#8217;s success story demonstrates the importance of persistence and discipline in trading. He started small with his own money and worked his way up to a fully-funded trading account. His transition from trading individual stocks to ETFs and reliance on price action and support and resistance levels instead of technical indicators highlights the need for traders to adapt and evolve with the market. Domingo&#8217;s interview provides valuable insights into his journey as a trader and his strategies for success.</p>

<h3>Tell us a little bit about yourself</h3>
<p>Married w 2 kids. Grew up with the idea that I always wanted to be self-employed. After starting many small businesses, I found trading. The idea of being able to master a high-income skill and make this my business is what drives me. To be able to run a home-based business with unlimited income potential with no overhead, employees, inventory, etc. I enjoy water sports and golfing. I would love to be able to share this high-income skill with as many people as possible, especially my friends, family, and children.</p>
<h3>How long have you been trading?</h3>
<p>I have been studying for 4 to 10 hours per day for the past 14 months. This includes courses, reading, podcasts, and screen time. I am a scalper.</p>
<h3>Briefly describe your Trading Plan and how it contributes to your success.</h3>
<p>My trading plan incorporates the structure of the chart as the most important foundation. Demand and supply zones and key levels. I am looking at channels, ranges, and market equilibrium.I have a strategy for ranges, channels, and trends.</p>
<h3>Share with us a challenge you faced in your trading career and how you overcame it</h3>
<p>My biggest challenge has been risk management. I love your platform as it has fixed rules in place to close trades when a trade loss limit is reached and also when daily loss limits are reached. In my opinion, the 2 biggest rules that cause traders to lose and blow accounts are.</p>
<p><a href="https://ftnfu.com"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3474 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2.jpg" alt="ttp - a prop firm for Forex Traders" width="960" height="120" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2.jpg 960w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2-300x38.jpg 300w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blog-banner2-768x96.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></p>
<h3>How did you adjust risk management to your trading personality?</h3>
<p>I am continually improving on closing positions faster when the trade goes against me—allowing me to focus on the next trade, which may be on the same setup if still valid.</p>
<h3>Describe a key moment in your trading career</h3>
<p>My biggest moments were when I blew up an account. The drive inside me knows that as long as I never quit, I will become a master day trader.Another key moment has been meeting my 2 mentors Navin from Urban forex and the GOAT Eric from Spy Day Trading, who regularly has 7 figure days trading SPY. Navin taught me my foundation. The logic of trading, The concept of the Big Boys, buyers/sellers territoryEric teaches me structure, equilibrium, and how big boys and professional traders never lose money trading&#8230; they use various options strategies and hedging to protect themselves.</p>
<h3>How long did it take for you to become a consistent trader, and what aspects did you change for that?</h3>
<p>It took me 1 year.</p>
<h3>What is your mental/psychological strength, and how did you develop it</h3>
<p>Aggression. As a former poker player, I learned not to focus on the dollar amount but to recognize when the odds are in my favor and when to step on the gas, which is why I am a scalper. Aggressive traders can not go for home runs. They must get in and out as structure demands. Risk vs. reward. I have been developing since I was in elementary school, selling candy door to door, then watching my father as a small business owner, then the biggest is failing over and over.</p>
<h3>What was your strategy for successfully passing the evaluation phase?</h3>
<p>In 1 word structure. If I am not mistaken, the days after the bank collapse offered a great opportunity for a retracement trade, as this type of news generally is an overreaction. By observing structure, and levels, I was able to be ready by watching the structure develop and price action to find its support level.</p>
<h3>How is trading for Funded Trades  Now For You different from trading by yourself?</h3>
<p>The biggest is that your service has the capital and the strict risk management rules in place that are not moveable. They require the trader to ahere to the rules. I believe if each trader who is by themselves had these rules in place without the ability to move stop loss or daily losses, there would be so many more successful traders.</p>
<h3>What would you recommend to someone who is just starting with us?</h3>
<p>I absolutely would recommend traders to your service. However, I believe they must 1st learn the logic of trading and structure, ranges, and equilibrium.</p>
<h3>Share online resources that were/are significant in your trading development. Names and links are appreciated</h3>
<p>Navin @ <a href="https://www.youtu.com/@urbanforex">Urban Forex</a> and Eric @ <a href="https://www.youtu.com/@SPYDayTrading">Spy Day Trading</a>. Both on youtu</p>
<h3>Would you like to share anything else with us?</h3>
<p>Thank you, TTP.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>“Protect the capital. Use small wins to build your cushion” That’s Olga’s Advice.</h2>
<h3>Let&#8217;s meet Olga R. From Germany</h3>
<p>Olga has successfully passed our <a href="https://.com/">Extra Trading Capital</a> program and is now one of FTNFU’s funded traders, or as we call it, “Stock Star.” and managing $160,000 from the pool.<br />
Every time he reaches 5 consecutive winning days, we will boost his buying power and max exposure.<br />
We spoke with Olga about his trading plan, insights, and lessons gained while trading in the markets and our platform as a funded trader.</p>
<h2>Watch The Interview With Olga</h2>
<p><iframe title="Olga is Managing a $160,000 Trading Halt Strategy - Funded Trades  Now For You Fund" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtu.com/embed/VonVJab0OGQ?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>An insight into Olga&#8217;s approach to trading</h2>
<p>One of the key points that Olga emphasizes is the importance of protecting one&#8217;s capital. She suggests that <strong>new traders should not go too big and instead focus on making small wins that can be used to generate larger profits over time.</strong> This approach allows traders to gradually build their portfolio and minimize the risk of significant losses.</p>
<p>Olga also discusses her background as a trader and how she developed her <a href="https://.com/types-of-day-trading-strategies/">trading strategies</a>. She started with penny stocks and gradually moved up to blue chip stocks and other trading tactics until she found her own style that was profitable for her. She also emphasizes the importance of psychology in trading and how she has been learning about trading psychology from her mentor.</p>
<h3>Olga&#8217;s strategy for finding the right stocks</h3>
<p>Olga explains that she uses <a href="https://.com/trade-ideas/">trade ideas</a> and concentrates on top gainers and losers to get an overview of the market. She also uses level 2 data from a platform called &#8220;<strong>DAS Trader</strong>&#8221; to understand when a stock is going on halt and when it is time to enter or exit a trade.</p>
<p>Olga notes that her strategy typically focuses on penny stocks because they offer more opportunities for gains and her approach to trading these stocks involves monitoring the first &#8220;halt&#8221; that goes up or down and entering the trade based on that movement.</p>
<h3>Discipline, patience, and risk management</h3>
<p>Overall, Olga&#8217;s experience and advice highlight the importance of discipline, patience, and risk management in trading. Traders who are just starting out should focus on protecting their capital and gradually building their portfolio over time. Developing a solid trading strategy takes time and experimentation, and <strong>traders should be prepared to learn from their mistakes and make adjustments as necessary.</strong></p>
<h3>Have a mentor by your side</h3>
<p>The conversation also emphasizes the importance of having a mentor or partner who can provide guidance and support. Olga has been able to learn from her mentor and review her trades together to identify what went well and what didn&#8217;t. This kind of feedback and reflection is critical for traders to improve and become more successful over time.</p>
<h2>In summary</h2>
<p>The video provides valuable insights into the world of trading and highlights the importance of discipline, patience, and risk management for traders who are just starting out. Olga&#8217;s experience and advice offer a roadmap for new traders to follow as they navigate the complex and challenging world of trading.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that we all know that the Fed can (and does) lower the <a href="https://.com/fomc/">interest rate</a> to boost economic <a href="https://.com/unemployment-rate/">growth and employment</a> or it can raise it to fight <a href="https://.com/inflation/">inflation</a>, let’s talk a little about the other, relatively new &#8211; power that the FED has at its disposal: <strong>money printing. A.k.a. Quantitative Easing (QE).</strong><br />
The power of printing money whenever you need it would seem like a dream for anyone but, as we all know, with great power comes great responsibility and this is no exception.<br />
Powers and responsibilities regarding QE are the focus of this article &#8211; the fourth of the “Federal Reserve System” series &#8211; and to better comprehend it all, we need to take a quick jump back in time to 2008.<br />
Heck of a jump, I know but, then again, a heck of a year too; stay with me.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Where did it all start</h2>
<p>During the economic crisis of 2008, GDP fell by 4.3% making it the worst recession in 60 years.<br />
In the US alone, 8.8 million people lost their jobs and 6 million houses were repossessed. In Wall Street, the bear market lasted 17 months and was enough to “rob” the S&amp;P 500 of half its value.</p>
<p><strong>On 15 September 2008, Lehman Brothers, the World&#8217;s fourth-largest investment bank, shocked the World by <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2008/BUSINESS/09/15/lehman.bankruptcy/?iid=EL">filing for bankruptcy</a>.</strong> The stock market crashed. People kept losing their jobs. Banks did not trust other banks and businesses and refused to lend to either as well as to the public.</p>
<h3>The recession that changed everything</h3>
<p>2008 was the year (and a half) of the Great Recession but it was also the year the FED made two important, “everything-changing” decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The first decision was made upon the realization that, given the intricacies of “investment globalization” and the amount of capital it represents, <strong>some businesses are, literally, “too big to fail”.</strong><br />
It could be argued that the ramifications of this decision are anti-capitalism and going against “free market spirit” (and it was argued. Animatedly too) but from the FED’s perspective, protecting the economy and maximizing employment is part of the mandate and it must adhere to it… apparently, at all costs.<br />
The concept referred primarily to banks and large insurance companies but there is no real clear restriction and once Pandora’s box is open, there is no putting anything back.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The second decision the FED took might have been viewed as even more drastic and it was made after realizing that the economy risked imploding due to a lack of credit and capital. It lowered its interest rate target from 4.5% at the end of 2007 to just 2% in September 2008 but the cost of credit wasn’t the issue; trust and credibility were.  Banks were determined to avoid any risk amid the turmoil and kept refusing to lend to one another as well as to businesses.  That’s when the FED created a new way to fight a recession and “printed” its way out of it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quantitative Easing (QE)</h3>
<p>In previous articles of this series, we have talked about how the FED can change the interest rate to influence the availability and cost of credit. We know that to do this, the FED raises or lowers the interest it charges to other banks (the Federal Funds Rate) and that this creates a ripple effect that affects the interest rate on all the other loans.</p>
<p><strong>But there is another way to inject capital into the markets and the economy; a faster and more efficient way: Quantitative Easing.</strong></p>
<p>Starting in Japan and used in the US for the first time during the 2008 crisis, the process consists of the Central Bank buying Government bonds and other securities (mostly mortgage-backed) from the open market and paying for them with money that the FED can digitally create themselves.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3425 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/qe.png" alt="QE Quantitative Easing" width="698" height="252" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/qe.png 698w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/qe-300x108.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /></p>
<p><strong>This powerful monetary policy has the double effect of making bonds more expensive (and, therefore, stock more attractive) and injecting a huge amount of money into the economy which provides banks with a greater incentive to lend.</strong></p>
<p>Being able to create money from seemingly thin air &#8211; added to that of manipulating the interest rates &#8211; would undoubtedly seem like the best “superpower” to have to prevent any recession, yet the new policy was, at first, received with anger, criticism and protests with tens of thousands of people marching in the streets.<br />
In 2008, it wasn’t easy &#8211; and it will never be easy &#8211; for the FED and the Government to explain to “The People” why some businesses could not be allowed to fail. It was hard to explain why huge investment banks had to be saved even if considered “the cause of the crisis”. And, it was hard to explain to “ The People” why they had to be forced through a long period of austerity and forced to help those businesses against their will.<br />
It is all very understandable.</p>
<p>However, <strong>the truth is that it is really hard to imagine what the outcome would have been had the FED not intervened.</strong><br />
The American economy is notarially strong and resilient but the pillars that support it can be a little more brittle and need regular management. That’s what the FED does and, as we now know,  that’s the FOMC mandate.</p>
<p><strong>During the Great Recession, the FED QE managed to finance Government&#8217;s guarantee and bailouts worth £498 billion which helped restore trust and sentiment in the market.</strong> The abundance of funds, higher cost of bonds and low-interest rates have all pushed banks to compete with one another for a share of the lending market.</p>
<p>The economy flourished and kept flourishing. GDP increased year after year while the stock market reached a higher and higher level. Unemployment was low and “The People” had higher incomes and started spending more. Way more.<br />
Everything was great. The recession was over and it was the beginning of a bull market that carried on and reached its highest level in 2021.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>There has to be a catch</h3>
<p>Of course there is.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3408 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/since-2008-the-bull-market-never-stopped.jpg" alt="since the 2088 crisis the bull market have never stopped" width="474" height="383" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/since-2008-the-bull-market-never-stopped.jpg 474w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/since-2008-the-bull-market-never-stopped-300x242.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /></p>
<p>It is true; since the 2008 crisis, the bull market and “the happy days” have never stopped but it is also true that neither has the “printing” nor is the ultra-low interest rate.<br />
The FED has continued quantitative easing without interruption since 2007, when it first introduced the policy. <strong>This, many argue, gives the American economy an artificial advantage which may not always reflect real economic growth and can, therefore, result in high inflation, market bubbles and public discontent.</strong></p>
<p>In the article on “<a href="https://.com/inflation/">Inflation</a>”, we have already seen the damages that “too much money” in the system can create to the economy if it’s not equally matched by a growth in GDP. In this article, as well as in the one on “<a href="https://.com/unemployment-rate/">unemployment</a>”, we’ve seen the troubles that can occur when the money in the system is instead not enough.</p>
<p>The Fed’s set of tools is powerful but its job is not simple. The perfect equilibrium of economic bliss is hard to find &#8211; <em>let alone achieve</em> &#8211; in a market that is, by nature, free.</p>
<p>The current economic downturn and high inflation are the newest challenges for the FED.<br />
The money printed in existence and put in circulation during the 2008 recession is shadowed by the money created during the Covid pandemic.<br />
High inflation was to be expected; the war in Europe perhaps wasn’t.<br />
With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the high inflation level post-pandemic &#8211; which was thought to be only temporary &#8211; escalated due to sanctions and major disruption in the supply of energy and food commodities. The Fed had to take hard and unpopular decisions and it certainly did so but… this is a topic for another future article. Stay tuned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the first article of the “Federal Reserve System” series, we spoke about the different elements that compose the “Fed” and about the <a href="https://.com/fomc/">FOMC</a> in particular. We have described the Fed’s mandate as “maximizing employment while protecting the Dollar and the American economy” and we’ve also briefly talked of the different ways it has to achieve it.<br />
In this second article, we’ll explain what the Unemployment Rate is and the effect it has on the economy and the market.</p>
<h2>What is the Unemployment Rate?</h2>
<p>Well, put simply the “Unemployment rate” is the way we measure the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the total labor force.<br />
It is one of the most important indicators of an economy’s health; it directly affects it and it is, at the same time, directly affected by it. This is the reason why maximizing employment is a perennial objective of all, the voters, the Fed and the Government.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, <strong>in a healthy and growing economy, the Unemployment Rate tends to be low as Companies have more money to invest and more need to recruit new staff whilst, during economic downturns, Companies are more likely to reduce staff as well as investments causing the Unemployment rate to increase instead.</strong><br />
On the other hand, a high level of employment means that more people have more money to spend. And when people have more money to spend, generally, they spend it. And that’s great for the economy.</p>
<p><strong>A high level of unemployment indicates that the economy is inefficient and under-producing.</strong></p>
<h2>What can the Government and the Fed do to reduce unemployment?</h2>
<h3>The Government</h3>
<p>Politicians who see a high level of employment during their term are more likely to enjoy the approval of both the voters and the <a href="https://.com/analyze-the-market/">financial market</a>. It’s not surprising, therefore, that fighting unemployment is always high up on any political agenda and that the Government has tools of its own to try and “put more people into work”. These includes (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tax cuts or tax benefits to businesses</strong> (to increase Companies&#8217; capital for investments that could partly be spent on recruiting workers).</li>
<li><strong>Tax cuts or tax benefits to the general public</strong> (to increase public spending and Companies’ revenue which, again, can be used to employ workers).</li>
<li><strong>Increase targeted public expenditure</strong> (the government can increase its spending on projects that directly affect the employment levels such as infrastructure projects, apprenticeships and employment subsidies to Companies that recruits a sufficient number of people).</li>
<li><strong>Targeted policies</strong> (such as improving urban and extra-urban mobility, reducing power to the Trade Unions to reduce wage bargaining, improving employment-market flexibility and tightening requirements to receive unemployment-related benefits.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"></li>
</ul>
<h3>The Federal Reserve System</h3>
<p>Whilst the Government is in full control of all Fiscal policies to boost economic growth, the Fed is charged with controlling and deciding on the monetary ones.<br />
The Fed uses its control to effectively “inject money into the economy” to boost employment levels (as part of its mandate) and “withdraw money out the economy” when it needs to reduce inflation (the other part of its mandate).</p>
<p>To increase the money supply in the economy and the employment levels, the Fed has many tools at its disposal, the most common of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Reducing the (short-term) Interest Rate</strong> (this makes “money cheaper”. It allows Companies to borrow more money at a cheaper interest rate which, in turn, allows them to spend more money on recruiting and other investments).</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Open Market Operations</strong> (the Fed buys Treasury Bonds from the open market effectively swapping bonds for cash that is free to enter the market, boost the economy and, in turn, again, increase employment.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Reducing the reserve requirements</strong> (banks have more capital available for lending and investing. This increases the amount of money in circulation which makes it easier for people to buy companies’ products and services and makes it cheaper for companies to borrow money to invest and recruit)</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do Unemployment Rate announcements affect the market?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-3299 size-full" src="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Unemployment-Rate.jpg" alt="Unemployment rate federal announcements affect on the market" width="740" height="337" srcset="https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Unemployment-Rate.jpg 740w, https://.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Unemployment-Rate-300x137.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></p>
<p>Unemployment rate figures are released on the first Friday of each month and refer to the prior month.<br />
As well as the Fed and the Government, traders and investors also give particular relevance to the unemployment figures. Low unemployment means that Companies can expect higher demand for their product and services and what kind of investor wouldn’t like that?<br />
Moreover, when companies expect higher demand they are more likely to decide to invest in more staff to increase production. This would further increase employment which, in turn, would further increase demand.</p>
<p>Market sentiment concerning the unemployment rate is better expressed by the inverse relationship it has with S&amp;P500.</p>
<p>When the announced Unemployment Rate is higher than the previous month, the S&amp;P500 price often increases and vice-versa.</p>
<h2>How important are Unemployment Rate announcements for traders?</h2>
<p>The Unemployment Rate is a lagging indicator and gives an insight into changes in the economy that have already occurred rather than into those that are happening now. Nonetheless, the figures can further help to understand current events and predict future market behavior.</p>
<p>Traders need to be particularly aware of increased volatility when the Unemployment Rate announced is different from what the market expected.</p>
<h2>What’s next in the “Federal Reserve System” series?</h2>
<p>So far, we learned that the “Fed” is formed by the seven members of the “Board of Governors”, the twelve Federal Reserve Banks and FOMC, we talked about the Fed’s mandate to maximize employment and safeguard the Dollar and the American economy and examined the tools the Fed has to boost employment level.<br />
In the next article, the focus will be on <strong>“Inflation”; the other side of the coin.</strong><br />
Now that we know how the Fed has the power of “creating” capital and inject it into the economy, we will discuss what happens when <strong>“a lot of money in the economy becomes too much money in the economy”</strong>, we’ll find out what the Fed can do to prevent it and protect currency and economy and you’ll understand why it’s so important for traders and investors.</p>
<p>As always, I hope this helped!</p>
